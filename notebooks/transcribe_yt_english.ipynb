       "\"WEBVTT\\n\\n00:02.080 --> 00:06.232\\nHello everyone. Welcome to Stream. I'm CCPP and you're tuning into the New Eden\\n\\n00:06.296 --> 00:09.560\\nReview Dev show. Totally not picked for the acronym\\n\\n00:09.640 --> 00:13.288\\nnerds, Am I right, Swift? Yep, that's exactly right. Because we're\\n\\n00:13.304 --> 00:15.784\\njust a bunch of nerds. We are a bunch of nerds. We're nerds.\\n\\n00:15.912 --> 00:18.872\\nAbsolutely. This is a new show we've been wanting to do for a while with\\n\\n00:18.896 --> 00:22.712\\na kind of laid back, kind of podcasty style. And today we're going to go\\n\\n00:22.736 --> 00:26.440\\nover patch notes. We're going to talk about how we feel about everything\\n\\n00:26.480 --> 00:29.462\\nthat's come out so far. We might use this show in the future to go\\n\\n00:29.486 --> 00:32.294\\nover things like Community beats and other things, but we don't want to stick to\\n\\n00:32.302 --> 00:36.118\\na schedule or like commit to one at the moment. Today though, we have\\n\\n00:36.174 --> 00:40.214\\nan insanely long patch to go over and I have two fantastic\\n\\n00:40.262 --> 00:43.814\\nguests with me. CCP Trash Panda, CCP Swift. You guys are well known in the\\n\\n00:43.822 --> 00:47.542\\ncommunity. How are you guys doing today? Pretty good. It's a really good day.\\n\\n00:47.646 --> 00:50.902\\nWent through the patch notes, scrolled for like 45 minutes and\\n\\n00:50.926 --> 00:54.422\\nit just felt really nice. Yes. We were watching Erst and I actually did\\n\\n00:54.446 --> 00:58.158\\nlike announcement like, okay, it's 10 to 1 or something and he's finally\\n\\n00:58.174 --> 01:01.850\\nfinished reading or 10 to 12. Took him only 50 minutes to go through it.\\n\\n01:02.310 --> 01:05.022\\nSo we have a bunch of different things. We're not going to go through it\\n\\n01:05.046 --> 01:07.662\\nword by word. I'm sure a bunch of streamers out there are going to go\\n\\n01:07.686 --> 01:10.782\\nand do that and you can talk about everything in super detail. I kind\\n\\n01:10.806 --> 01:13.854\\nof wanted to go and dive into just how you feel about certain parts of\\n\\n01:13.862 --> 01:17.774\\nit because I was putting in things like the Ansiblex force projection\\n\\n01:17.822 --> 01:21.318\\nthings into patch notes and I was just giddy with excitement. I'm like,\\n\\n01:21.414 --> 01:25.334\\nfinally the day is here. We're affecting Force Projection. Do you\\n\\n01:25.342 --> 01:28.690\\nthink we've gone far enough? Too far. How do you feel about A Trash B?\\n\\n01:29.310 --> 01:32.694\\nWell, for me it's. It like Force protection is a problem depending on\\n\\n01:32.702 --> 01:35.990\\nwho you ask. Yeah, like for the, for the person, the day to day,\\n\\n01:36.030 --> 01:39.894\\nlike line member. I mean it's actually quite bad to like remove\\n\\n01:39.942 --> 01:43.318\\nthat type of stuff. But actually as a whole, when you look at the game\\n\\n01:43.374 --> 01:46.890\\nlike Force Protection is actually quite. Can be quite oppressive.\\n\\n01:47.240 --> 01:50.928\\nSo for me, I think like doing these like targeted small\\n\\n01:50.984 --> 01:54.336\\nchanges piece by piece to kind of address some of the smaller\\n\\n01:54.368 --> 01:57.744\\nproblems and to build up to a large thing actually feels really good.\\n\\n01:57.832 --> 02:02.288\\nLike especially things when we're looking at like smaller\\n\\n02:02.304 --> 02:06.368\\nthings like the 100 kilometer anchoring\\n\\n02:06.544 --> 02:10.112\\nlike that, or, sorry, 1,000 kilometers, 10,000. Just taking them off the grid.\\n\\n02:10.176 --> 02:13.702\\nExactly, exactly. In my opinion, that's one of the biggest things, like trying\\n\\n02:13.726 --> 02:17.462\\nto hunt a group that can move their fleets from gate anything,\\n\\n02:17.526 --> 02:20.534\\nsee the next jump bridge and then just continue.\\n\\n02:20.622 --> 02:24.262\\nI think it's so strong to see the grid you're landing on and\\n\\n02:24.286 --> 02:28.166\\nthen you're seeing the gate from the other side. It leaves no place to interdict\\n\\n02:28.198 --> 02:30.950\\nthem and stop them anyway. Right? Yeah. And it's also,\\n\\n02:31.070 --> 02:35.526\\nif you think about it as well, it's the time travel\\n\\n02:35.718 --> 02:38.908\\nand the amount of time it takes to get from one place to another.\\n\\n02:39.014 --> 02:42.192\\nIf they're so close to each other, obviously that time is very minimal. So when\\n\\n02:42.216 --> 02:45.472\\nyou spread that out, it actually means that the time to engage is a little\\n\\n02:45.496 --> 02:48.544\\nbit longer, and that feels a lot healthier. I think in general,\\n\\n02:48.712 --> 02:51.792\\nwe've had a few conversations about this and just seen people talk\\n\\n02:51.816 --> 02:55.312\\nabout this with. About how we're not actually addressing the\\n\\n02:55.336 --> 02:59.504\\nfact that people can still chain jump to different regions and this makes local\\n\\n02:59.672 --> 03:03.008\\ntraveling a bit more dangerous. Do you not see that in\\n\\n03:03.064 --> 03:06.264\\nthe future people will still have more trouble keeping, like,\\n\\n03:06.272 --> 03:09.752\\nthe edges of their space? Yeah, that's kind of everything up and running.\\n\\n03:09.816 --> 03:12.792\\nThat's what we were talking about with. Instead of just adding fatigue or something like\\n\\n03:12.816 --> 03:16.120\\nthat, which, you know, we've done before, doesn't feel\\n\\n03:16.160 --> 03:19.140\\nso great. Why is fatigue bad? It just.\\n\\n03:19.840 --> 03:23.592\\nHow long do we have? No, no, it just. It just\\n\\n03:23.616 --> 03:27.032\\ndoesn't feel great. Especially if you're, like, trying to rapidly move around your\\n\\n03:27.056 --> 03:30.280\\nspace and then come back. You just build up fatigue and then there's an op\\n\\n03:30.320 --> 03:33.824\\nlater and you're like, well, I can't join, guys, because I've got. Because I was\\n\\n03:33.832 --> 03:37.392\\ntwo jump bridges away and I have to wait, actually. Wait. I just. I was\\n\\n03:37.416 --> 03:40.752\\nover there, so it doesn't. Feel great to have that. So making them a lot\\n\\n03:40.776 --> 03:44.576\\nmore disruptible, which is what this change does, gives players tools\\n\\n03:44.608 --> 03:48.224\\nto, like, mess with, like, the big sweeping, like, jump bridge\\n\\n03:48.272 --> 03:51.808\\nnetworks, right? Yeah. It gives you a strategic tool that's a little bit smaller.\\n\\n03:51.904 --> 03:55.168\\nLet's say you're going to reinforce like a metanox or something.\\n\\n03:55.304 --> 03:58.240\\nYou can take out a crucial jump bridge or a crucial, like,\\n\\n03:58.280 --> 04:01.830\\nconnection. You can just camp it. If you've got, like, a smaller fleet,\\n\\n04:01.990 --> 04:05.958\\nthere are so many options. And this is like, really similar to what we'd seen\\n\\n04:06.094 --> 04:10.090\\nin, like, previous versions of. Of, like, jump bridges\\n\\n04:10.590 --> 04:14.902\\nthat when they were on paes, like, we saw that mechanic play out and.\\n\\n04:15.006 --> 04:18.646\\nYeah, Just giving tools to the players to be able to,\\n\\n04:18.718 --> 04:21.894\\nyou know, cause a little bit of havoc. We also made the an blixes like\\n\\n04:21.902 --> 04:25.302\\na little bit chunkier and beefier. Yes. Increasing the resist\\n\\n04:25.366 --> 04:28.572\\nso, you know, if you're trying to rep it and save it 70%. So now\\n\\n04:28.596 --> 04:31.164\\nyou can actually be on grid and wrap it with effects and it's going to\\n\\n04:31.172 --> 04:33.964\\nbe hard to kill it while you're wrapping it. Yeah. And just more hp,\\n\\n04:34.012 --> 04:37.596\\nlike more effective. Hit points overall as well, but less HP in total because we\\n\\n04:37.668 --> 04:41.532\\ntook the shield and the armor down a little bit. Yeah. But then\\n\\n04:41.556 --> 04:45.212\\nthere has been talks about this bubbling of them and that the fact\\n\\n04:45.236 --> 04:48.428\\nthat if you get bubbled, you can't jump through. People are already saying, oh,\\n\\n04:48.444 --> 04:51.132\\nthey're going to revert it next week. Do you think we're going to revert it\\n\\n04:51.156 --> 04:54.784\\nanytime soon? I, I don't think so personally. Like, I think\\n\\n04:54.872 --> 04:58.368\\nfor, for me it feels like having\\n\\n04:58.424 --> 05:01.392\\nthat get out of jail free card to go through an unspec when you're being\\n\\n05:01.416 --> 05:04.720\\nchased, like, that feels like it's not particularly fun for the,\\n\\n05:04.760 --> 05:08.352\\nfor the attacker. So I feel like in general, like that type of,\\n\\n05:08.536 --> 05:12.352\\nlike stopping that type of play, like, I feel is\\n\\n05:12.376 --> 05:15.552\\npretty, pretty cool. Like, I'm pretty happy with that. There will be a lot\\n\\n05:15.576 --> 05:19.488\\nof cloaked interdictors on various gates.\\n\\n05:19.584 --> 05:23.338\\nYeah. But I mean, you'll see them in local, you'll know that they're there.\\n\\n05:23.394 --> 05:27.194\\nYou, you're able to, you know, you're able to smart bomb the\\n\\n05:27.202 --> 05:30.746\\nbubble off at zero, which is different from normal gates. You can't smart bomb\\n\\n05:30.778 --> 05:33.914\\nthere. I mean, if you warp to one and there's like 50 people locally and\\n\\n05:33.922 --> 05:37.050\\nyou get bombed by a bomber fleet, you kind of had it common, right?\\n\\n05:37.090 --> 05:40.330\\nYeah. So. But you can also make different plays out of it. So.\\n\\n05:40.370 --> 05:44.058\\nYeah. And they're just the, the added strategy elements that get\\n\\n05:44.114 --> 05:47.780\\nput into place when there's like a new area in space where you can mess\\n\\n05:47.820 --> 05:51.252\\nwith people. Yeah. A new area in space where like if you go in,\\n\\n05:51.356 --> 05:54.420\\ntry and get a fight, like let's say, oh, you're going to a metanox,\\n\\n05:54.500 --> 05:58.244\\nthey're not fighting you there. Maybe they'll start fighting over a\\n\\n05:58.252 --> 06:01.556\\njump bridge. Because, you know, now we.\\n\\n06:01.628 --> 06:05.060\\nOne of the big things, probably the biggest thing that for me,\\n\\n06:05.100 --> 06:08.516\\nat least for the jump bridges, is we removed auto repair.\\n\\n06:08.628 --> 06:11.300\\nSo it repairs like a metanox now. Right.\\n\\n06:11.340 --> 06:15.332\\nSo you have to physically go out in space, commit stuff\\n\\n06:15.476 --> 06:18.692\\nto kind of turn this thing back on. Which means that\\n\\n06:18.716 --> 06:22.084\\nwhen someone's There fighting over it. There's like a\\n\\n06:22.092 --> 06:25.332\\nbit of a sense of urgency to go out and kind of push them\\n\\n06:25.356 --> 06:29.092\\noff when they ring the bell. You also don't just go to a timer and\\n\\n06:29.116 --> 06:31.892\\nsit there for 50 minutes and then go back home. You have to physically do\\n\\n06:31.916 --> 06:35.236\\nsomething. And the further away it is from where you're\\n\\n06:35.268 --> 06:38.356\\nbased, which everyone's just like, in a couple of different places.\\n\\n06:38.388 --> 06:41.732\\nLet's be honest. The further away it is, the more hassle is to\\n\\n06:41.756 --> 06:44.884\\nkeep those things up and running. Yeah. So if you're like a nuisance at the\\n\\n06:44.892 --> 06:48.244\\nedge of someone's face, I think you can be, like, quite a thorn in\\n\\n06:48.252 --> 06:51.924\\ntheir shoe. I think it's very reminiscent of the, like, the old pulse\\n\\n06:52.052 --> 06:55.348\\nmechanics. And I think that's. That's something that actually I quite liked\\n\\n06:55.444 --> 06:58.692\\nfrom the. From mechanics. And we were changing the back to being called\\n\\n06:58.716 --> 07:02.036\\njump bridges. Yeah. So that's very true.\\n\\n07:02.148 --> 07:05.422\\nYeah. I just, I. I like that idea of, like, you know, you've had\\n\\n07:05.446 --> 07:08.142\\nall of your structures hit and you now have to go out and actually do\\n\\n07:08.166 --> 07:10.942\\nsomething to fix them. And I think that's, you know, they. Have a bunch of\\n\\n07:10.966 --> 07:14.290\\nPA sprays in NPC delve. Yeah, P. Yeah.\\n\\n07:15.830 --> 07:18.382\\nYou're always too scared of you nerds. You'd show up, you're like, oh, P.\\n\\n07:18.406 --> 07:21.742\\nI was a local, you know, so just bring P.\\n\\n07:21.846 --> 07:25.534\\nAnd nothing bigger. Yeah. Not worth trying. Wait till you get real desperate.\\n\\n07:25.582 --> 07:29.006\\nBring out a carrier or something. Back then,\\n\\n07:29.078 --> 07:32.520\\nyeah. We also changed warp speed changes,\\n\\n07:32.600 --> 07:35.656\\nso we adjusted some of these. I didn't realize we were up to, like,\\n\\n07:35.728 --> 07:39.260\\nwhat, 13 different warp speeds. Yeah, it's wild.\\n\\n07:40.160 --> 07:43.480\\nThe reasoning behind this is just honestly to get newer players\\n\\n07:43.520 --> 07:47.400\\nto understand easier, like, why something is faster than other things.\\n\\n07:47.520 --> 07:50.952\\nObviously, ships like Interceptors and I think\\n\\n07:50.976 --> 07:53.020\\nInterdictors as well, they're still going to be faster.\\n\\n07:53.920 --> 07:57.496\\nThings like the angel ships are going. To still be faster than naturally faster\\n\\n07:57.528 --> 08:00.744\\nas well. Yeah. But it didn't make sense that some of the things are faster\\n\\n08:00.792 --> 08:04.536\\nthan others. Yeah. It was actually just when you. When you looked at the numbers,\\n\\n08:04.568 --> 08:08.232\\nit was like, okay, Stealth bombers have this speed.\\n\\n08:08.296 --> 08:11.624\\nYeah. Assault frigates have this speed. Frigates have this speed.\\n\\n08:11.672 --> 08:14.952\\nIt's like, well, they're all also kind of the same holes. And so you end\\n\\n08:14.976 --> 08:18.072\\nup like, there's so many different. Like,\\n\\n08:18.176 --> 08:21.560\\nthey're in different warp speed categories. And so really,\\n\\n08:21.600 --> 08:25.238\\nwhen you think about it, it's much simpler just to block those all together\\n\\n08:25.294 --> 08:28.566\\nand then allow the roll bonuses to dictate the.\\n\\n08:28.638 --> 08:32.230\\nThe special role for the ship. Yeah. Like the Special speed. Yeah, it's a lot\\n\\n08:32.270 --> 08:35.718\\neasier just to conceptualize that. Hey, an interceptor. I can see it's\\n\\n08:35.734 --> 08:39.670\\ngot a bonus to go faster instead of just having your show info going to\\n\\n08:39.790 --> 08:43.730\\nthe attributes tab being like, okay, it's this number I have to go back here.\\n\\n08:44.430 --> 08:48.134\\nBut yeah, this is kind of similar to how it was\\n\\n08:48.222 --> 08:52.474\\na few years ago as well, where we had fewer categories.\\n\\n08:52.602 --> 08:56.042\\nAlso, I think strictly speaking, most things just got a little bit faster with\\n\\n08:56.066 --> 08:59.642\\nthe exception of hacks. Hacks got a little bit slower, but everything else just\\n\\n08:59.666 --> 09:02.410\\ngot a little bit faster. Titans are going to be a little bit faster.\\n\\n09:02.570 --> 09:05.930\\nNot much freighters as well. Yeah,\\n\\n09:06.090 --> 09:08.510\\nbut I mean the, the mining barges,\\n\\n09:09.250 --> 09:12.602\\nthe. Some of the haulers were like slower than battleships apparently.\\n\\n09:12.666 --> 09:16.010\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. And there were like haulers had like four\\n\\n09:16.050 --> 09:19.988\\ndifferent warp speeds depending on which one. Yeah, like even Tech1 haulers had different\\n\\n09:20.044 --> 09:24.004\\nwarp speeds as well. Yeah, I think that's, that's complex\\n\\n09:24.052 --> 09:26.932\\nfor no reason for a new player to try and learn and go, why am\\n\\n09:26.956 --> 09:30.212\\nI slower? Yeah, faster. Cuz at least some of the haulers are\\n\\n09:30.236 --> 09:33.876\\nlike agility focused so they should be faster. But that's not\\n\\n09:33.948 --> 09:37.684\\nreally like explained well enough in, in the description.\\n\\n09:37.732 --> 09:41.284\\nSo it's like it's easier just to clump them together. And if, if a ship\\n\\n09:41.332 --> 09:44.560\\nneeds to go faster, we can just add the roll binders to the.\\n\\n09:45.300 --> 09:49.084\\nSince we're talking force projection, we decided\\n\\n09:49.132 --> 09:53.388\\nto put filaments right after these two things. Yeah. Because filaments\\n\\n09:53.484 --> 09:57.324\\nare a way to move around and they have been incredibly\\n\\n09:57.372 --> 10:00.572\\npowerful for a long time. I have loved and abused the\\n\\n10:00.596 --> 10:03.852\\nhell out of them because they're so easy to get out of trouble. They get\\n\\n10:03.876 --> 10:06.760\\ninto trouble. We are changing them quite a bit.\\n\\n10:07.220 --> 10:10.492\\nThis spool up time that we're putting on them and the effect that\\n\\n10:10.516 --> 10:13.634\\nyou can't use them on dead space grids. Yeah, that's the big one.\\n\\n10:13.692 --> 10:17.110\\nThat's a really big one. But that wasn't the way things used\\n\\n10:17.150 --> 10:20.262\\nto be. You didn't just be, you know, you weren't able to have just a\\n\\n10:20.286 --> 10:23.782\\nbutton to go and teleport into some trouble and go, oh, I'm. Let me just\\n\\n10:23.806 --> 10:25.570\\nteleport out somewhere else again.\\n\\n10:26.990 --> 10:30.166\\nWe did briefly communicate this as like POTS fan, only for a while.\\n\\n10:30.238 --> 10:33.990\\nBut this is going to be all filaments, is that correct? Yeah, all travel filaments.\\n\\n10:34.070 --> 10:37.478\\nAll travel filaments. So needle jacks. The yule\\n\\n10:37.654 --> 10:41.454\\nevery travel. Yeah, the, the reindeer. The reindeer.\\n\\n10:41.502 --> 10:45.118\\nThat's where they came in. Also scales with like\\n\\n10:45.174 --> 10:48.414\\nthe size as well. So if you're smaller group, you'll be able to go a\\n\\n10:48.422 --> 10:51.422\\nlittle bit faster. But the bigger fleets, you'll have to stay in space a little\\n\\n10:51.446 --> 10:55.150\\nbit longer. Yeah, that just gives like people a little bit more counterplay. Right.\\n\\n10:55.190 --> 10:59.102\\nBecause it just felt a little bit unfair for\\n\\n10:59.126 --> 11:02.382\\nthe people that lived in the space that like,\\n\\n11:02.406 --> 11:05.566\\noh, these people came in, we're, we're formed up, we're ready\\n\\n11:05.598 --> 11:08.660\\nto kill them. They're just running in, kind of hiding away.\\n\\n11:09.200 --> 11:12.536\\nNow there's an ability to try and catch them a little bit and punish\\n\\n11:12.568 --> 11:15.912\\nthem for that. Yeah. And I think from my perspective, well, that's one of the\\n\\n11:15.936 --> 11:19.864\\nbetter ways of handling this type of problem is like add in counterplay\\n\\n11:19.912 --> 11:23.160\\nfor it don't just like strictly nerf. It's like,\\n\\n11:23.200 --> 11:27.176\\nokay, what does it open up for the other people that want to\\n\\n11:27.328 --> 11:30.696\\nengage with that? This spool up. When it happens,\\n\\n11:30.808 --> 11:33.704\\nit's going to be, it's going to be different. You're not going to click a\\n\\n11:33.712 --> 11:37.272\\nbutton and just everyone disappears. There's going to be a different time. On the\\n\\n11:37.296 --> 11:41.042\\ntype of filament, like you're saying, but how exactly does it work?\\n\\n11:41.146 --> 11:44.162\\nYou turn on the filament and you have to wait the time. But there's a\\n\\n11:44.186 --> 11:47.282\\n30 kilometer bubble you have to ring, you have to stay\\n\\n11:47.306 --> 11:50.562\\ninside of. Yeah, that's right. You can move around in there. Yeah, you can move\\n\\n11:50.586 --> 11:53.794\\naround, but there's a 30 kilometer bubble if you leave. That,\\n\\n11:53.882 --> 11:57.710\\nor if I call it bubble, because people are like, wait, wait, it's a 30\\n\\n11:58.250 --> 12:01.186\\nkilometer sphere that you need to stay within range of. Yeah,\\n\\n12:01.218 --> 12:04.994\\nexactly. But yeah, so if you left that, then you're immediately\\n\\n12:05.042 --> 12:08.858\\ndelink from it. And then also if you engage someone,\\n\\n12:08.914 --> 12:11.962\\nobviously you'll delete your link as well. But I mean, the way that it kind\\n\\n12:11.986 --> 12:15.578\\nof plays is almost like it's almost like you're deploying a mobile depot.\\n\\n12:15.674 --> 12:19.626\\nYou get the little ring up here as it activates\\n\\n12:19.658 --> 12:22.470\\nand then once it activates, you then jump through.\\n\\n12:22.770 --> 12:26.378\\nBut yeah, it's essentially just like as if you were deploying a mobile depot,\\n\\n12:26.394 --> 12:30.506\\nbut obviously it's a filament. And then after that time, which as Swift said\\n\\n12:30.658 --> 12:33.946\\nvaries depending on the size, then the rift opens\\n\\n12:33.978 --> 12:37.546\\nup and then you can activate and jump through it. Does the person,\\n\\n12:37.698 --> 12:41.082\\nthe fleet commander, then click a button? Everyone jump now? Or is it an\\n\\n12:41.106 --> 12:44.666\\nautomatic thing? It's an automatic thing, yeah. So you have to be there. If you're\\n\\n12:44.698 --> 12:48.378\\ntoo far away, cloaked, you're not going to get taken with. Yeah, yeah,\\n\\n12:48.394 --> 12:51.914\\nexactly. It's Going to be a very interesting change to roaming.\\n\\n12:51.962 --> 12:55.642\\nBut if we're honest with ourselves, it has been really strong to\\n\\n12:55.666 --> 12:59.246\\nbe able to go to just an ESS grid and burn up like\\n\\n12:59.318 --> 13:02.958\\n4 or 500. Yeah. And then just like, leave. Yeah.\\n\\n13:02.974 --> 13:05.530\\nAnd these changes all come into the. Like,\\n\\n13:06.390 --> 13:09.246\\nthey're all. I hate to say this word, but they're all kind of like holistic.\\n\\n13:09.278 --> 13:12.766\\nRight. So we're giving people the ability to harass things like jump\\n\\n13:12.798 --> 13:16.030\\nbridges. Yeah. And then we're taking away a little bit of,\\n\\n13:16.070 --> 13:19.550\\nlike, the ease of travel to get in and out of space. So it's not\\n\\n13:19.590 --> 13:22.942\\njust strictly hitting one thing, it's just kind of looking at the whole system in\\n\\n13:22.966 --> 13:26.740\\ngeneral. Yeah, it's a very good way to look at it. Yeah, for sure.\\n\\n13:27.280 --> 13:31.128\\nI know there's going to be lots of talk about it. I think there's\\n\\n13:31.144 --> 13:35.096\\nprobably going to be people that use this to bait. I'm sure you can.\\n\\n13:35.168 --> 13:38.700\\nCan entice someone to come to your filaments.\\n\\n13:39.120 --> 13:42.776\\nThe filaments in pots are a bit longer as well, so maybe you'd\\n\\n13:42.808 --> 13:45.720\\nsit there with a longer timer and a bunch of other things cloaked around it.\\n\\n13:45.760 --> 13:48.088\\nYeah. They don't pop up on overview. Right. You have to be able to probe.\\n\\n13:48.104 --> 13:50.664\\nThem, but then you can descan them and see there is one and then you\\n\\n13:50.672 --> 13:54.322\\ncan combat probe it. Yeah. Just want to make sure people didn't know or\\n\\n13:54.346 --> 13:57.842\\ndidn't want to, like, have to miss into interpretation. There'd be like a big\\n\\n13:57.866 --> 14:01.122\\nbeacon in space that everyone just could. They're like official filaments. You can see them\\n\\n14:01.146 --> 14:04.418\\non scan, you can combat scan them down. And of course, if you're on grip\\n\\n14:04.434 --> 14:06.630\\nwith them, they'll be on the open. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\n14:08.250 --> 14:11.810\\nGood stuff. So a bunch of other things\\n\\n14:11.930 --> 14:15.682\\ncame into this patch as well. Lots of balancing on ships. The EOS we\\n\\n14:15.706 --> 14:19.602\\ntoned down from being a sentry boat. Yeah. This is\\n\\n14:19.626 --> 14:23.698\\nmore about kind of making it more in line with the class that it's\\n\\n14:23.714 --> 14:27.298\\nin. Kind of like when we changed the VNI to not be five heavy\\n\\n14:27.314 --> 14:30.850\\ndrones. VNI is still very useful ship. Yeah. But it's a completely different\\n\\n14:30.890 --> 14:34.946\\nthing than it used to be. Yeah, for sure. Was the EOS just Giga\\n\\n14:34.978 --> 14:38.482\\noverperforming compared to its peers? That was my impression\\n\\n14:38.546 --> 14:41.794\\nfrom what we were talking. We had quite a long session with the CSM as\\n\\n14:41.802 --> 14:44.670\\nwell. Yes. And they identified this as a particularly, like,\\n\\n14:45.310 --> 14:48.518\\noppressive ship in general, specifically for the century zones.\\n\\n14:48.614 --> 14:52.038\\nAnd that's why, like, when we're looking at the problem, it's. You you don't\\n\\n14:52.054 --> 14:54.870\\nwant to just nerf the ship to the ground. No, because that's not.\\n\\n14:54.910 --> 14:58.566\\nThat's also not fun. So the idea of splitting the\\n\\n14:58.638 --> 15:02.022\\nbonuses just made so much sense because then it's like, okay, we can pull back\\n\\n15:02.046 --> 15:05.622\\non the thing that is being oppressive. You can still keep it as\\n\\n15:05.646 --> 15:09.174\\na, you know, by. By definition, like a powerful drone ship.\\n\\n15:09.222 --> 15:13.148\\nYeah. And it still has that. That capabilities. I think that's quite a clever,\\n\\n15:13.324 --> 15:17.452\\nlike, yeah, push and pull on that. Yeah, it's. It's also makes\\n\\n15:17.476 --> 15:20.764\\nit a lot easier to make adjustments too, as well, because the way it\\n\\n15:20.772 --> 15:24.364\\nwas existing before, like, oh, I guess we have to Nerf all sentry terms like.\\n\\n15:24.372 --> 15:28.076\\nNo, no. Yeah, just one ship is having problems with it\\n\\n15:28.148 --> 15:31.708\\nin terms of just outperforming things in their class or\\n\\n15:31.764 --> 15:34.892\\nrespective to their class. Yeah. So, yeah, I think this is a really. A really\\n\\n15:34.916 --> 15:38.108\\nsolid change. Yeah, you brought up a really good point. Some.\\n\\n15:38.164 --> 15:41.522\\nA lot of these things were brought up as discussion points during our most\\n\\n15:41.546 --> 15:45.090\\nrecent CSM summit, which was. It feels like\\n\\n15:45.130 --> 15:48.590\\na long time ago, but it was just like barely a month ago.\\n\\n15:49.130 --> 15:52.706\\nWe had all these nerds locked into a room for a week talking\\n\\n15:52.738 --> 15:56.706\\nabout spaceships. But yeah, a lot of the force projection changes\\n\\n15:56.738 --> 16:00.482\\nand those conversations started there. We had like a different. Well, they didn't start there.\\n\\n16:00.506 --> 16:03.938\\nWe were talking about that with other CSS before. Yeah. Like, as long as I've\\n\\n16:03.954 --> 16:07.146\\nbeen here with csm, we've talked about fourth projection. Yeah, we've talked about fourth project.\\n\\n16:07.178 --> 16:10.474\\nBut we had a consensus of. Yeah, an implementation\\n\\n16:10.602 --> 16:13.866\\nstrategy. That's probably the best way to put it. Yeah, thanks for the correction.\\n\\n16:13.898 --> 16:17.930\\nYeah. Because we had like a whole different number of\\n\\n16:17.970 --> 16:21.070\\ndifferent approaches that we could have done with the Anzaplexes.\\n\\n16:21.890 --> 16:25.450\\nJust, you know, things that we've discussed before is making it locked to\\n\\n16:25.490 --> 16:29.110\\na single alliance. Yeah, we talked about the pros and cons of that.\\n\\n16:29.490 --> 16:32.410\\nI know previously we had some concepts where, you know,\\n\\n16:32.450 --> 16:36.350\\nactivating Anzaplex would, like, leave it open for people to follow through.\\n\\n16:36.470 --> 16:39.662\\nThere are some drawbacks in that. And really when we got to discussing it,\\n\\n16:39.686 --> 16:42.878\\nit was just like making them, you know,\\n\\n16:42.934 --> 16:45.822\\nharassable and being able to be, you know,\\n\\n16:45.846 --> 16:49.262\\nshut down. Yeah. Was really the best approach for at least our\\n\\n16:49.286 --> 16:52.542\\nfirst look at force projection, or rather this look at.\\n\\n16:52.566 --> 16:55.918\\nFor projection. We're still going to like, keep looking at it. And as.\\n\\n16:55.974 --> 17:00.206\\nAs I said earlier, like, it is making these small incremental\\n\\n17:00.238 --> 17:03.618\\nchanges that really, like, allows us to not like we're\\n\\n17:03.634 --> 17:07.026\\nnot making big swings and then if we miss We've\\n\\n17:07.058 --> 17:10.562\\nmissed massively, you know. Yeah. Going back to\\n\\n17:10.586 --> 17:14.402\\nthe Eos, it's. I mean there's still sentry like ships out\\n\\n17:14.426 --> 17:18.018\\nthere. The, the Dominics, the, the sin they can still really\\n\\n17:18.074 --> 17:21.474\\ndo century long range things like 240 kilometer stuff.\\n\\n17:21.522 --> 17:24.754\\nYeah. But the Eos is like a different, like its mass is so\\n\\n17:24.762 --> 17:28.780\\nmuch smaller. If you think in wormholes and like. Yeah, this makes sense.\\n\\n17:28.940 --> 17:31.676\\nBut I'm sure there's lots of people with the Yosas out there going God damn,\\n\\n17:31.708 --> 17:34.524\\nI need to find someone else. Yeah. Well you can still do a lot of\\n\\n17:34.532 --> 17:37.148\\nwhat you were doing before, but you're gonna have to do some trade offs.\\n\\n17:37.164 --> 17:40.252\\nRight. You're gonna have to modify your low so you don't get the tank,\\n\\n17:40.396 --> 17:44.076\\nthe mobility and the damage all at once. You have to like pick two.\\n\\n17:44.228 --> 17:47.612\\nYeah. We're also changing the Orca and\\n\\n17:47.636 --> 17:51.260\\nwe're making it a bit more, more agile. But there's one here,\\n\\n17:51.300 --> 17:54.522\\nthe heavy interdiction cruisers going to be able to\\n\\n17:54.546 --> 17:57.510\\nfit Cynos again. Yes. That's a pretty big one.\\n\\n17:57.810 --> 18:01.210\\nTalk to us about why that is being done. Well,\\n\\n18:01.250 --> 18:04.714\\nI mean in general it was, it was within conversations with the\\n\\n18:04.722 --> 18:08.298\\nCSM Y. It was just like we, we have these ships\\n\\n18:08.314 --> 18:11.242\\nwhich are used in this type of like combat anyway.\\n\\n18:11.306 --> 18:15.402\\nYeah. It's, it doesn't necessarily\\n\\n18:15.466 --> 18:18.778\\nmake them overpowered and it's something that like the players\\n\\n18:18.834 --> 18:22.228\\nwanted. It was just like let's just go for it. We discussed this actually quite\\n\\n18:22.244 --> 18:25.316\\na lot with the CSM and just in between us here at the office,\\n\\n18:25.468 --> 18:28.900\\nlike a hick. You can't wrap it when it has its bubble up. It has\\n\\n18:28.940 --> 18:32.452\\nother, other things. Sure. It's way tankier than like an Arazu. Yeah.\\n\\n18:32.516 --> 18:36.340\\nIt can't warp cloaked or there's other fallbacks. Yeah. But it's so funny. It comes\\n\\n18:36.380 --> 18:39.188\\nup every now and then when I'm talking to friends that every ship once upon\\n\\n18:39.204 --> 18:42.724\\na time could fit a silo which if you were to\\n\\n18:42.812 --> 18:46.456\\ngo the other direction, if it had always been the way it is now and\\n\\n18:46.508 --> 18:49.072\\njust going every ship will fit a sign on now people would go, are you\\n\\n18:49.096 --> 18:52.832\\ncrazy? Like every ship. So I think this is actually like a\\n\\n18:52.856 --> 18:56.192\\nreally good step of this makes sense as a ship. There doesn't need to\\n\\n18:56.216 --> 18:59.808\\nbe two characters there. If you're trying to like bubble hold\\n\\n18:59.864 --> 19:02.864\\nsomething like a, I don't know, super or Titan or something.\\n\\n19:03.032 --> 19:06.672\\nA hard sign like this does make sense. Yeah. You could always bring\\n\\n19:06.696 --> 19:09.776\\nin like a black ops, but that's kind of different too.\\n\\n19:09.848 --> 19:14.536\\nSure. I think also when you, when you think about it as like if\\n\\n19:14.608 --> 19:18.136\\nthe hick is say the ick is like infinite\\n\\n19:18.168 --> 19:21.448\\npointing something. Yeah. Like the, the benefit of\\n\\n19:21.504 --> 19:25.048\\nhaving that hick is that it can. It's smaller and it can move\\n\\n19:25.184 --> 19:28.184\\nso it's a harder to hit. But then if you wanted to then light a\\n\\n19:28.192 --> 19:31.032\\nsino at that point also. It has to stop and sit still.\\n\\n19:31.216 --> 19:34.760\\nThen it's dead essentially. Very much so. Yeah. There's a lot of counter play\\n\\n19:34.800 --> 19:38.376\\nto it. And like you were saying before, the way the gameplay had evolved is\\n\\n19:38.448 --> 19:42.258\\nyeah going to take my alt and a recon to bring in my\\n\\n19:42.314 --> 19:46.066\\nhick or just have a hick logged off in system and I'll have my alt\\n\\n19:46.098 --> 19:49.890\\nthere. So like sinoing in bringing like a. A big\\n\\n19:49.930 --> 19:53.490\\nfleet in. It was always had pretty much evolved\\n\\n19:53.570 --> 19:56.930\\nto just like a role that you did\\n\\n19:56.970 --> 19:59.830\\non an alt and it didn't. Feel like you were throw away AU.\\n\\n20:00.250 --> 20:03.698\\nAnd so it also added cost to all these types of fights and you're\\n\\n20:03.714 --> 20:06.866\\ngoing to need redundancy because the ships aren't that tanky.\\n\\n20:07.058 --> 20:10.530\\nSo especially if you're talking about like a big dread brawl, you want\\n\\n20:10.570 --> 20:13.730\\nsomething that's dependable that you can kind of bring in. We were lucky on Live\\n\\n20:13.770 --> 20:17.410\\nto feed the other day when a certain someone jumped Marshall after\\n\\n20:17.450 --> 20:19.990\\nus. Yeah, that was amazing.\\n\\n20:20.890 --> 20:24.130\\nWe just kept fragging all the arouses. Yeah. That would not have worked with\\n\\n20:24.170 --> 20:27.106\\nwith Hicks with side notes. That is true. Maybe that was a one off.\\n\\n20:27.178 --> 20:31.298\\nYeah. Yeah. Of all our years of playing Eve that had happened\\n\\n20:31.394 --> 20:34.802\\nexactly once but yes, but still I want to do it\\n\\n20:34.826 --> 20:37.998\\nagain. It was a good one. The other huge change here\\n\\n20:38.054 --> 20:41.102\\nis burst jammers no longer on every ship.\\n\\n20:41.246 --> 20:45.250\\nIt'll only be on battleships, haulers and command ships.\\n\\n20:46.230 --> 20:49.470\\nECM bursts have annoyed the hell out of me for a long time.\\n\\n20:49.510 --> 20:53.166\\nSo when I saw this was coming I was super excited. Things like interceptors burst\\n\\n20:53.198 --> 20:56.846\\njamming fleets is just degenerate gameplay.\\n\\n20:56.878 --> 21:00.330\\nLet's be honest here. Multi boxing Griffins like\\n\\n21:00.630 --> 21:03.450\\njust going in. Bursting and then leaving again.\\n\\n21:03.990 --> 21:07.730\\nI'm really happy to see this one coming. Yeah, it's especially annoying\\n\\n21:08.310 --> 21:11.742\\nin like a tie dye fight as well. Yeah. And you\\n\\n21:11.766 --> 21:15.310\\nknow we tried to take a few swings at this before we had\\n\\n21:15.350 --> 21:18.894\\nbeen like okay, no interdiction with these things. You know make it\\n\\n21:18.902 --> 21:22.622\\na little bit more cap intensive to use. But still players figured out a good\\n\\n21:22.646 --> 21:26.094\\nway like a way around it. I'm sure they will again like people are\\n\\n21:26.102 --> 21:29.582\\nalready theory crafting like certain sigils that can be like really\\n\\n21:29.606 --> 21:31.930\\nquick to warp Any CM burst.\\n\\n21:32.830 --> 21:35.702\\nBut at the same time, I think I would really like to see just a\\n\\n21:35.726 --> 21:40.070\\nhauler fleet come in. Be like, oh, I'm gonna then\\n\\n21:40.110 --> 21:42.650\\njust get obliterated. Or not, who knows?\\n\\n21:43.230 --> 21:46.358\\nBut yeah, it's something we're gonna keep looking at as well. Because you're\\n\\n21:46.374 --> 21:48.610\\nright, it does get to the point where it's just.\\n\\n21:49.230 --> 21:52.902\\nIt's just really obnoxious more than anything else. And there are\\n\\n21:52.926 --> 21:56.390\\nother tools that like, there are lock breaker bombs that can do something.\\n\\n21:56.430 --> 21:59.808\\nTool like very similar. And this kind of undercuts\\n\\n21:59.824 --> 22:02.860\\na lot of that as well. Completely dead. Yeah, sure.\\n\\n22:04.840 --> 22:08.976\\nThere's the other one here about the C13 wormholes having their lifetime\\n\\n22:09.008 --> 22:11.968\\nreduced from 16 to 4 and a half hours. Correct me if I'm wrong,\\n\\n22:11.984 --> 22:16.176\\nThese are the brig wormholes into shattered wormholes. Correct. They're kind of unrollable.\\n\\n22:16.288 --> 22:19.456\\nYeah. Why are we reducing their time? The,\\n\\n22:19.528 --> 22:23.502\\nthe. I mean, there's quite, quite a small reason really. It's just\\n\\n22:23.696 --> 22:26.850\\nbring them in line with the other ones. Yeah, that's basically it.\\n\\n22:26.970 --> 22:30.354\\nThey're just. They were. They were off by quite a large factor from. From the\\n\\n22:30.362 --> 22:33.458\\nother, other holes. It was just like, just bring it, bring it in line.\\n\\n22:33.514 --> 22:36.466\\nThat was kind of it. Yeah. And also like, when you'd see it, if you'd\\n\\n22:36.498 --> 22:40.578\\nbe like, oh, it spawns and it's like, it's EOL and so don't\\n\\n22:40.594 --> 22:44.066\\nknow what that even means. Yeah. Is that gonna be like, my entire day's ruined.\\n\\n22:44.178 --> 22:47.746\\nI can't do anything here because I'm afraid of there's gonna be like a swarm\\n\\n22:47.778 --> 22:50.978\\ncoming through here. Or can I like, realistically wait like a\\n\\n22:51.034 --> 22:54.562\\nfew hours and just say, okay, I'll wait some time to\\n\\n22:54.586 --> 22:58.674\\nget to like a little bit less risky time gameplay.\\n\\n22:58.802 --> 23:01.870\\nSo, yeah, bringing it in line with all the other ones before and.\\n\\n23:02.650 --> 23:07.186\\nYeah, makes sense. Moving on to factional warfare.\\n\\n23:07.378 --> 23:09.954\\nThe pirate FOB is going to drop a bill and a half now when he\\n\\n23:09.962 --> 23:13.058\\ngets killed. Well, indeed. Yeah. Before he drop nothing. Correct. Yeah.\\n\\n23:13.154 --> 23:15.826\\nSo there's going to be like an actual reason to go and siege those.\\n\\n23:15.898 --> 23:19.586\\nYep. But we're also changing the sites. Scouts and Smalls\\n\\n23:19.618 --> 23:22.946\\nare going to be Navy 2 and Pirate 2. Mediums are going to be Navy\\n\\n23:22.978 --> 23:26.114\\n3 and Pirate 3 and larges are Navy 4, Pirate 4. So they're going\\n\\n23:26.122 --> 23:29.314\\nto be smaller, fewer pilots in\\n\\n23:29.322 --> 23:32.830\\nthem. Correct. Why are we doing that?\\n\\n23:33.930 --> 23:37.218\\nI mean, in general, we've been looking at the.\\n\\n23:37.274 --> 23:41.138\\nWell, okay, there's a couple of things. One of the things is when we're\\n\\n23:41.154 --> 23:44.882\\nlooking at the sites we have to consider that that's just the payout amount.\\n\\n23:45.026 --> 23:48.162\\nSo, like, obviously there's more people can go into these sites in general,\\n\\n23:48.346 --> 23:51.846\\nbut in terms of the actual payout amount, like, it's. It can be\\n\\n23:51.918 --> 23:54.694\\nespecially in sort of the smaller ones. If you're just looking at the singles,\\n\\n23:54.822 --> 23:57.814\\nonly one person can get the payout from that. So having the,\\n\\n23:57.902 --> 24:01.382\\nlike, making it so that two people can kind\\n\\n24:01.406 --> 24:04.758\\nof reduces the amount of awoks that happens within faction warfare\\n\\n24:04.774 --> 24:08.150\\nin general. But. But when we're looking at these types of things, we're just\\n\\n24:08.190 --> 24:13.030\\nlooking at the. The participation, the amount of like, the amount of like,\\n\\n24:13.070 --> 24:16.422\\ndestruction that happens within these. We felt like it would be a good idea to\\n\\n24:16.446 --> 24:19.712\\njust bring these, like. Okay. Adjust these around, which is kind of cool.\\n\\n24:19.856 --> 24:24.096\\nI like it. Fleet improvements.\\n\\n24:24.288 --> 24:27.792\\nThere's an option to disband the fleet instead of like the FC\\n\\n24:27.856 --> 24:30.832\\nleaving and someone just becoming the boss. Yeah.\\n\\n24:30.976 --> 24:34.820\\nWhoever's alt that might be. Right. The random AFK guy.\\n\\n24:35.160 --> 24:38.832\\nAnd then you're going to be able to flag yourself exempt from\\n\\n24:38.856 --> 24:41.808\\nconduit jumps. And the regroup command.\\n\\n24:41.984 --> 24:45.244\\nThe regroup command is actually bigger in my eyes.\\n\\n24:45.372 --> 24:48.924\\nYou're not pulling all your scouts and everyone. Yeah. Who are manually\\n\\n24:48.972 --> 24:52.812\\npiloting. You're just like 90 degrees. Pull them in a different direction and they\\n\\n24:52.836 --> 24:56.588\\nget fragged. Like. Oh, yeah. I think that's a. That's a huge one\\n\\n24:56.724 --> 25:00.396\\nfor those, like, snowflake rolls. Yeah. I fly a lot of dictors and like boost\\n\\n25:00.428 --> 25:03.532\\nships. Yeah. It's dangerous to put me in\\n\\n25:03.556 --> 25:06.668\\none, but I still like to do it. And yeah, you're exactly\\n\\n25:06.684 --> 25:09.676\\nright. I'm trying to move to the right spot. And then they're regrouping the fleet.\\n\\n25:09.708 --> 25:13.392\\nI'm like, shirt this way. And the disband fleet button is\\n\\n25:13.416 --> 25:16.976\\njust huge. Like, being able to just kill a fleet has so much utility\\n\\n25:17.008 --> 25:20.208\\nin it. You know, joining a new fleet or\\n\\n25:20.264 --> 25:23.712\\njust like the ops done. Yeah. Don't have to worry about as like\\n\\n25:23.736 --> 25:26.780\\nan fc. You have to just previously, you just want to kick everyone,\\n\\n25:27.240 --> 25:30.976\\nmake sure the big ships are out of the fleet so whoever gets it doesn't\\n\\n25:31.008 --> 25:34.672\\naccidentally do something that they don't want to do or\\n\\n25:34.696 --> 25:37.794\\nmaybe they do want to do. Yeah. So, yeah. Just being\\n\\n25:37.802 --> 25:41.538\\nable to disband the fleet, it seems so dumb and so simple, but it's gonna\\n\\n25:41.554 --> 25:45.010\\nmake so many lives that much easier. And that's like. There are so many\\n\\n25:45.050 --> 25:48.722\\nof these, like, types of improvements in this patch where\\n\\n25:48.746 --> 25:51.298\\nthere's like. I think we were counting. There's like a dozen or like two Dozen\\n\\n25:51.314 --> 25:54.418\\nof these. That's gonna affect all different areas of space.\\n\\n25:54.554 --> 25:57.938\\nYeah, yeah, exactly. And it's also just things like when it comes to the.\\n\\n25:57.994 --> 26:01.266\\nThe. The exempt from conjure,\\n\\n26:01.298 --> 26:04.802\\njump and regroup, it's like, well, we already have the.\\n\\n26:04.906 --> 26:08.226\\nThe flag exempt from fleet war. Yeah. Like why.\\n\\n26:08.298 --> 26:12.338\\nIf we, if we have the ability to artificially control someone's\\n\\n26:12.354 --> 26:15.874\\nship, whether it be regroup or jump, then we should have the exam.\\n\\n26:16.002 --> 26:19.870\\nLike it's just a thing we should do. You know, I think it's also just.\\n\\n26:21.530 --> 26:25.266\\nI think it's like a safety thing for. I don't know,\\n\\n26:25.338 --> 26:28.610\\nwhat do you call it? You're. You're. You're not\\n\\n26:28.650 --> 26:32.930\\nscared that someone eventually is going to just boost one of your really special\\n\\n26:32.970 --> 26:37.064\\nships away? It shouldn't be done that way. So I\\n\\n26:37.072 --> 26:41.176\\nthink this is actually a pretty healthy change. Yeah, maybe. Maybe the butterfly\\n\\n26:41.208 --> 26:44.072\\neffect. We'll see more alliance tournament ships out in space.\\n\\n26:44.256 --> 26:48.380\\nMaybe because people won't be worried about. This is just like crazy,\\n\\n26:48.720 --> 26:52.168\\ncrazy CCB swift thinking right now. And maybe what's\\n\\n26:52.184 --> 26:54.440\\nhappening. Right. Yeah. And just maybe some like,\\n\\n26:54.480 --> 26:57.864\\nhopefully maybe I'm trying to manifest more anti ships in\\n\\n26:57.872 --> 27:01.868\\nspace because. Yeah. You don't have to worry about someone just like teleporting you.\\n\\n27:01.924 --> 27:05.212\\nYeah. Offspace while you're like, not at your computer. We did\\n\\n27:05.236 --> 27:08.796\\njoke about when conduit came to carriers. We're like, what if in big fights\\n\\n27:08.828 --> 27:12.684\\nsomeone just conduits all the enemy, like monitors 15\\n\\n27:12.772 --> 27:16.188\\njumps away and there's good luck winning the fight.\\n\\n27:16.244 --> 27:19.612\\nThey're all a new way of head shotting just kind\\n\\n27:19.636 --> 27:22.716\\nof. I don't know. But we also added the ability to\\n\\n27:22.788 --> 27:26.190\\nbroadcast repair target. Yes. Which means that you can land\\n\\n27:26.300 --> 27:30.138\\nand be like, hey, that guy who's not in our fleet. Yes, Repair that guy.\\n\\n27:30.234 --> 27:34.506\\nWhich is like super nice. Instead of everyone scroll around finding the target called,\\n\\n27:34.658 --> 27:38.234\\nyou know, Pepe Johnson or something. You're like, where the hell is Pepe?\\n\\n27:38.282 --> 27:41.910\\nRight. So you're. This is a really good way to be able to.\\n\\n27:42.850 --> 27:46.074\\nYeah. To help another fleet or someone who's tackled or.\\n\\n27:46.162 --> 27:49.882\\nYeah, it's a healthy change. And I mean, the amount of times like you're in\\n\\n27:49.906 --> 27:53.562\\nfleet and there are multiple fleets happening at the same time and like whether\\n\\n27:53.586 --> 27:56.426\\nit be a support or whether it just be like another group of people,\\n\\n27:56.498 --> 28:00.048\\nlike force multiplying on people. Exactly. Yeah. It doesn't have to be just for\\n\\n28:00.104 --> 28:03.312\\nlike huge coalition warfare. It could just be like, I want these\\n\\n28:03.336 --> 28:06.656\\npeople to live. They're my meat shield. Yeah. Die slowly\\n\\n28:06.688 --> 28:09.904\\nthen me die slowly. So keep that guy wrapped. And what like, a lot of\\n\\n28:09.912 --> 28:13.984\\npeople would do to, like, try and emulate this is they'd broadcast\\n\\n28:14.032 --> 28:17.536\\nthe target and just be like, guys, when you see this name, don't shoot\\n\\n28:17.568 --> 28:20.960\\nit. Yeah. There's always someone in the fleet. Yeah. That's gonna shoot it.\\n\\n28:21.000 --> 28:24.182\\nAnd if you've not experienced it, you are probably the person in the fleet that\\n\\n28:24.206 --> 28:27.462\\nshoots the wrong guy. And in some cases, like the Logi pilots\\n\\n28:27.526 --> 28:31.222\\nwon't even have targets popping into the broadcast. Exactly. Yeah. They filter those\\n\\n28:31.246 --> 28:34.230\\nout because it's too much. Yeah. So now we have a way to just go,\\n\\n28:34.270 --> 28:37.958\\nhey, this is a repair command, maybe a dictator. You don't\\n\\n28:37.974 --> 28:40.774\\nwant to die like a friend who's holding something down.\\n\\n28:40.862 --> 28:43.810\\nYeah. Could be very important. I think it's a really good change.\\n\\n28:45.230 --> 28:48.310\\nWe had some graphical updates. We're not going to dip too deep in that.\\n\\n28:48.350 --> 28:51.924\\nWe changed some of the auto targeters and passive targeters. We've been doing this in\\n\\n28:51.932 --> 28:55.396\\nthe last few patches so that these. These old icons don't all look the same.\\n\\n28:55.468 --> 28:58.212\\nYeah, this is quite an ongoing effort. Yeah,\\n\\n28:58.276 --> 29:01.428\\nwe've, like, over the years, we've created lots\\n\\n29:01.444 --> 29:04.868\\nand lots of items and often use the same icon I\\n\\n29:04.924 --> 29:08.260\\nwas doing. I think it was last year when I started\\n\\n29:08.300 --> 29:11.732\\nlooking into it. And it's just like all of these things had exactly the same\\n\\n29:11.756 --> 29:15.412\\nicon. It's like, wow, okay. So, like, just making that. Making that\\n\\n29:15.436 --> 29:19.164\\neffort to, like, spread them out that hopefully creates,\\n\\n29:19.212 --> 29:22.668\\nlike, a little bit more understanding for the thing you've got and\\n\\n29:22.724 --> 29:26.204\\nalso, like, more recognition for, like, what that thing actually is and what it does.\\n\\n29:26.292 --> 29:29.852\\nI think I'm just now getting used to the damage mods\\n\\n29:29.916 --> 29:33.324\\nchanging a little bit. And now I can't, like, I can't imagine a\\n\\n29:33.332 --> 29:36.492\\nscenario. The old gyro. Yeah, we'll never see\\n\\n29:36.516 --> 29:39.852\\na gyro Erebus again. But it's fine. You never\\n\\n29:39.876 --> 29:42.860\\nknow. It's a fun story, but I put heat sinks on,\\n\\n29:42.900 --> 29:46.476\\nlike, on some ship. In the past on my Thorax because. It just sounded\\n\\n29:46.508 --> 29:50.296\\nlike you needed to dissipate the heat. Yeah, it sounded way better than a magnetic\\n\\n29:50.328 --> 29:52.664\\nfield stable. I didn't even know that was. I was like, But I know what\\n\\n29:52.672 --> 29:56.340\\na heatsink is. I want my hybrid turrets to shoot better.\\n\\n29:56.640 --> 29:59.800\\nAnd then as soon as I died, because I just ate it\\n\\n29:59.840 --> 30:03.144\\nbecause I thought my ship was fit horribly. The.\\n\\n30:03.232 --> 30:06.504\\nMy courtmate went in there and he was like, hey, why do you have all\\n\\n30:06.512 --> 30:10.104\\nthese heat sinks in your wreck? I'm like,\\n\\n30:10.112 --> 30:12.536\\nwhat do you mean? I need it for more damage.\\n\\n30:12.728 --> 30:16.498\\nObviously. No, you. You. You had. You had rails\\n\\n30:16.514 --> 30:19.698\\non this. Yeah. How old is this story?\\n\\n30:19.754 --> 30:23.458\\nIs this going? Like. I was gonna say 2004. Oh,\\n\\n30:23.474 --> 30:26.674\\nmy God. Okay, please. 21 years ago.\\n\\n30:26.842 --> 30:30.178\\nOh, no. My kidneys hurt just thinking\\n\\n30:30.194 --> 30:33.954\\nabout it. I can't read that, bro. There's too much lights.\\n\\n30:34.082 --> 30:37.458\\nJust say it out loud. This is a casual show.\\n\\n30:37.514 --> 30:40.418\\nDon't worry about it. All right. Twitch Chat, it's your pal.\\n\\n30:40.514 --> 30:44.362\\nWe are changing, and it's really important is the fuel types will now be\\n\\n30:44.386 --> 30:47.642\\nable to differentiate, like, fuel types, they have just a little bit of a\\n\\n30:47.666 --> 30:51.722\\nshade based on where they're from, so you won't accidentally take the\\n\\n30:51.746 --> 30:55.066\\nwrong fuel as Sus B. Yoden did this weekend.\\n\\n30:55.178 --> 30:58.506\\nYes. So. So what I was going to ask was,\\n\\n30:58.658 --> 31:02.170\\nthis is like a Revenant major update. Yeah, Right. Can they hear you?\\n\\n31:02.210 --> 31:05.290\\nYeah, yeah, Check and hear me. So this is Revenant major\\n\\n31:05.330 --> 31:08.946\\nupdate. So what is a major update in the context of e development Now?\\n\\n31:08.978 --> 31:12.690\\nNow, because Revenant came out last December and this\\n\\n31:12.810 --> 31:16.162\\nfeels like this is a very chunky addition to it, like some\\n\\n31:16.186 --> 31:19.538\\nthree months later. So how do major updates fit into\\n\\n31:19.594 --> 31:22.470\\nsort of like our intended development cycle?\\n\\n31:24.090 --> 31:27.842\\nYeah. So from our perspective, the thing that we're looking at is that\\n\\n31:28.026 --> 31:31.874\\nwe obviously were still sticking with expansions twice a year, but the\\n\\n31:31.882 --> 31:35.688\\nthing we want to make sure is that we are always looking at.\\n\\n31:35.874 --> 31:39.180\\nWe're always looking at the game, what we can do to improve, and then\\n\\n31:39.220 --> 31:42.620\\nalso when we release features in the expansion,\\n\\n31:42.780 --> 31:45.804\\nhow do we improve those? How do we iterate on those?\\n\\n31:45.972 --> 31:49.500\\nAnd so what we're looking at is that from a major. From this\\n\\n31:49.540 --> 31:53.052\\nmajor update perspective, if we could try and do that twice a\\n\\n31:53.076 --> 31:56.748\\nyear, so we end up with two big points\\n\\n31:56.804 --> 32:00.588\\nwhere we can kind of push all these things together and then essentially\\n\\n32:00.684 --> 32:03.634\\nhave them as one big package that we can, you know,\\n\\n32:03.722 --> 32:07.090\\nrevel in like this. But that's not to. That's not to stop\\n\\n32:07.130 --> 32:10.402\\nus deploying other things throughout the\\n\\n32:10.426 --> 32:12.914\\nyear. We're always going to be looking at the meta. We're always going to be\\n\\n32:12.922 --> 32:15.954\\nlooking at, like. And so if we see something that's wrong, we can. We can\\n\\n32:15.962 --> 32:19.746\\nlook to just patches and. Minor updates, but this is, like, concerted effort\\n\\n32:19.778 --> 32:23.714\\nto get a really big one out there. Yeah, precisely. And it also comes\\n\\n32:23.802 --> 32:26.626\\nthis year in particular, it comes off the back of the csm, so it gives\\n\\n32:26.658 --> 32:30.130\\nus a lot of opportunity to, like, introduce what they've been talking about\\n\\n32:30.170 --> 32:33.772\\nand what their desires are into this. Yeah. So, yeah, it's kind\\n\\n32:33.796 --> 32:37.244\\nof like a. It's it's, it's not an expansion.\\n\\n32:37.292 --> 32:40.796\\nIt's a, you know. Yeah. And like the expansions aren't\\n\\n32:40.828 --> 32:44.748\\nI think or seems to be. Okami put that, put it like this. The expansion\\n\\n32:44.764 --> 32:48.284\\nis not a moment in time. It's like a continuum. Right. Like we're addressing\\n\\n32:48.332 --> 32:51.932\\nthis one topic and we want to give ourselves enough time to be able to\\n\\n32:51.956 --> 32:55.132\\nlike iterate on it and be like ah, this isn't how we wanted it to\\n\\n32:55.156 --> 32:58.444\\nland. Instead of having to wait for like another expansion moment\\n\\n32:58.492 --> 33:02.004\\nor you know, some nebulous time in the future, you just be like,\\n\\n33:02.012 --> 33:05.076\\nokay, now we've got this really nice moment where we can do all this cool\\n\\n33:05.108 --> 33:08.516\\nstuff that we've been talking about. I don't think most people expected like force projection\\n\\n33:08.548 --> 33:12.980\\nto get touched. Now they were thinking like this summer or winter and\\n\\n33:13.020 --> 33:15.844\\nI think it kind of came as a surprise that they were. Oh it's becoming\\n\\n33:15.892 --> 33:19.844\\nmuch sooner and quicker. So. Yeah. And glad we got this. And same with\\n\\n33:19.852 --> 33:22.200\\nthe mining stuff, which is actually our next topic.\\n\\n33:22.540 --> 33:26.260\\nWe are adding tier 3 mining systems into\\n\\n33:26.300 --> 33:29.728\\nthe Equinox stuff. Yeah. With some big\\n\\n33:29.784 --> 33:33.232\\nass rocks. Really big compared to tier two. Really big\\n\\n33:33.256 --> 33:36.608\\nass rocks. We're also making the rocks in the tier 2 sites\\n\\n33:36.704 --> 33:41.472\\nfewer and bigger so there won't be like these rocks that you just basically\\n\\n33:41.536 --> 33:44.672\\nrun one cycle and you're like oh, I guess exactly, less than\\n\\n33:44.696 --> 33:48.912\\na cycle in some cases. This has been requested\\n\\n33:48.976 --> 33:52.860\\npretty, pretty heavily by the players.\\n\\n33:53.400 --> 33:57.470\\nOn top of that, people don't know there is no longer the compression button.\\n\\n33:57.550 --> 34:00.890\\nSo mining is in like a way better place now. Well,\\n\\n34:01.670 --> 34:04.654\\nit's better than it definitely was like six months ago.\\n\\n34:04.742 --> 34:08.510\\nSure, sure. These sites, are we worried about them being\\n\\n34:08.550 --> 34:12.174\\ntoo big? Are we worried about them undoing a\\n\\n34:12.182 --> 34:14.750\\nlot of the things we've been doing the last couple of years? No, no.\\n\\n34:14.790 --> 34:18.238\\nI mean, I think you know, as Kami\\n\\n34:18.254 --> 34:20.734\\nhas also been talking about it quite a lot but like the end of the\\n\\n34:20.742 --> 34:23.950\\nday we, we're trying to, we're trying to\\n\\n34:23.990 --> 34:27.470\\nmake improvements to the Equinox system. This is\\n\\n34:27.510 --> 34:30.574\\njust the, the next step in that like looking at. We,\\n\\n34:30.662 --> 34:34.174\\nyou know, we've now got some data back from Equinox. It's been out for a\\n\\n34:34.182 --> 34:37.806\\nwhile now. So we actually can you know, really look into it and understand what,\\n\\n34:37.878 --> 34:41.102\\nwhat the problems are. And this is our first like step in\\n\\n34:41.206 --> 34:45.290\\naddressing that. It looks like we just want to give more,\\n\\n34:45.670 --> 34:49.042\\nmore ore to the players and also reduce that tedium with the,\\n\\n34:49.066 --> 34:52.850\\nwith the rocks in general and obviously with the tier 3 site\\n\\n34:52.890 --> 34:56.274\\njust being like much bigger, much beefier, but obviously\\n\\n34:56.322 --> 34:58.946\\nlike it's going to have a larger cost to install. Yeah.\\n\\n34:59.058 --> 35:03.350\\n1800 power costs 18,100 workforce.\\n\\n35:04.810 --> 35:07.922\\nIt is more efficient in like every way. Like if you try and do the\\n\\n35:08.026 --> 35:11.570\\nmin maxing math, usually EVE doesn't scale too well. When you\\n\\n35:11.610 --> 35:15.790\\njust get bigger things, they're usually less efficient. This one's bigger and more efficient\\n\\n35:15.970 --> 35:19.654\\nbecause we, we like realize that it's hard to fit someplace.\\n\\n35:19.782 --> 35:23.750\\nSo it's going to be really like a strategic level kind\\n\\n35:23.790 --> 35:27.414\\nof upgrade that you would install in your, like the best area of\\n\\n35:27.422 --> 35:31.046\\nspace that you want to put it. Yeah. We're not going to dive too deep\\n\\n35:31.078 --> 35:34.406\\ninto the actual numbers, but the tier two sites and the tier\\n\\n35:34.438 --> 35:38.374\\nones are also getting buffed slightly. There's going to be the Mercoxet belt that\\n\\n35:38.382 --> 35:42.150\\ncould spawn. There's a guaranteed one that spawns in the\\n\\n35:42.270 --> 35:45.590\\ntier two and tier three. If you guys want to get into the,\\n\\n35:45.630 --> 35:49.558\\nthe depths of this, read the dev blog or the patch notes. Sorry.\\n\\n35:49.734 --> 35:52.582\\nAnd you can get all the details there about all the numbers.\\n\\n35:52.726 --> 35:56.790\\nYeah, it's gonna make. It's just like a lot like as you were saying before\\n\\n35:56.830 --> 36:00.050\\nwe move on, a lot of the feedback we got was like,\\n\\n36:00.670 --> 36:03.750\\nwe like the idea of this, but like it just doesn't feel good for us\\n\\n36:03.790 --> 36:06.902\\nright now. Yeah. So we took that, kind of turned that into stuff and you\\n\\n36:06.926 --> 36:10.262\\nknow, chopped 40% of the rocks out and just threw that mineral\\n\\n36:10.326 --> 36:14.034\\nvolume or that like excess small rocks into other rocks\\n\\n36:14.162 --> 36:17.458\\nto make them bigger and then just made all the sites bigger and then added\\n\\n36:17.514 --> 36:21.010\\nlike a guaranteed spawn for the.\\n\\n36:21.050 --> 36:24.194\\nThe Morit added a new deep core strip mining laser so\\n\\n36:24.202 --> 36:27.698\\nyou can get a 0% waste when you do that too. And, you know,\\n\\n36:27.754 --> 36:31.986\\nincrease the mining escalations, the chance of the mining escalation.\\n\\n36:32.098 --> 36:35.790\\nAnd now crucially, and this is like a weird change,\\n\\n36:36.330 --> 36:40.108\\nbut kind of hugely significant for us on the back end at least.\\n\\n36:40.274 --> 36:44.152\\nNow a site can persist through downtime where before,\\n\\n36:44.336 --> 36:47.720\\nif you've never really played around downtime, if a site was half\\n\\n36:47.760 --> 36:51.432\\ncomplete before downtime, it would completely refresh after downtime.\\n\\n36:51.576 --> 36:55.000\\nAnd so now we've figured out a way or mess\\n\\n36:55.040 --> 36:58.648\\nwith the spaghetti. I don't know. Mess with the spaghetti. Yeah, mess with the spaghetti\\n\\n36:58.664 --> 37:01.960\\nto make it so it can do just persist through downtime,\\n\\n37:02.040 --> 37:05.416\\nwhich gives the designers so many more tools in the future\\n\\n37:05.568 --> 37:09.098\\nto make different types of sites without having to worry about this\\n\\n37:09.154 --> 37:12.874\\narbitrary like 11 o'clock timer. Because when you're, when you're balancing a\\n\\n37:12.882 --> 37:16.890\\nsite, you're also balancing with the idea that, okay, if you\\n\\n37:17.010 --> 37:20.602\\ndid three, three quarters of a site before downtime, you get\\n\\n37:20.626 --> 37:24.618\\na whole new one on, you know, start up. Yeah. So it's just like\\n\\n37:24.754 --> 37:27.578\\nyou have to consider that in the balancing. But now that we have this,\\n\\n37:27.634 --> 37:31.310\\nlike we can, we can be a lot more cleaner with the balancing.\\n\\n37:31.890 --> 37:35.324\\nI did hear talks of like potentially we could in the future,\\n\\n37:35.482 --> 37:39.288\\nnot happening, but we could have a site that like lasts three weeks\\n\\n37:39.344 --> 37:42.328\\nor something and it's just an X amount of things in it. There's all kinds\\n\\n37:42.344 --> 37:45.320\\nof things you can do with it if it. Not if it doesn't just always\\n\\n37:45.360 --> 37:47.976\\nreset like you're talking about. So that's a, it's a good thing that we've gotten\\n\\n37:48.008 --> 37:50.460\\nthat, that over that hurdle.\\n\\n37:52.880 --> 37:58.584\\nPlanetary interaction. We had PI templates,\\n\\n37:58.632 --> 38:01.544\\nwhich was like an opt in for a while, but now let's become like a\\n\\n38:01.552 --> 38:04.100\\nnormal thing where everyone just has access to this.\\n\\n38:07.660 --> 38:10.708\\nTalk a little bit about like, why was that added?\\n\\n38:10.764 --> 38:14.100\\nHow was that added? Did this come from the other server?\\n\\n38:14.180 --> 38:17.812\\nYes. So this was actually made on the\\n\\n38:17.836 --> 38:20.836\\nChinese server and then ported over to us. Yeah,\\n\\n38:20.868 --> 38:25.332\\nyeah, so it was, I mean it was very, it was very rudimentary\\n\\n38:25.396 --> 38:28.724\\non the, on the. I forget. Serenity. Serenity,\\n\\n38:28.772 --> 38:31.604\\nyeah. I get confused between serenity and the other one. Yeah, I always call it\\n\\n38:31.612 --> 38:33.680\\nCC and I'm like, no, wait, no, no, no, no.\\n\\n38:35.080 --> 38:38.576\\nYeah, so it was very rudimentary on that server. But so when\\n\\n38:38.648 --> 38:42.464\\nwe pulled it over we kind of just, we wanted it as the beta\\n\\n38:42.512 --> 38:45.920\\nopt in just to like get some numbers on it, see how people actually\\n\\n38:45.960 --> 38:49.792\\nlike it. But then also we wanted to make sure that we were happy with\\n\\n38:49.816 --> 38:53.312\\nit from a UX perspective. Yeah, like making it actually like good to\\n\\n38:53.336 --> 38:56.752\\nuse. And yeah, we've been working on that for quite a bit\\n\\n38:56.776 --> 39:00.756\\nnow and like this patch in general we've been putting\\n\\n39:00.788 --> 39:04.372\\ntogether just some like polishes for it and things like\\n\\n39:04.476 --> 39:08.644\\neven things like actually being able to name the templates themselves.\\n\\n39:08.692 --> 39:11.716\\nThat type of stuff is really cool. And. Yeah,\\n\\n39:11.748 --> 39:14.980\\nand so now it's like, it's a feature that people\\n\\n39:15.020 --> 39:18.660\\ncan now just use which is really cool. And you can also restart with\\n\\n39:18.700 --> 39:22.276\\none button instead of having to go to. This is huge.\\n\\n39:22.468 --> 39:25.492\\nThat's going to save a lot of time. Yeah, we did it.\\n\\n39:25.516 --> 39:28.898\\nReddit. Exactly. Yeah. Because when you,\\n\\n39:28.954 --> 39:31.310\\nwhen, when you think about it,\\n\\n39:31.930 --> 39:34.818\\nonce you've set up, once you've spent the hours and hours to set up your,\\n\\n39:34.874 --> 39:38.002\\nyour farms, you end up. Then once you get\\n\\n39:38.026 --> 39:41.778\\ninto the extraction point, you set it for Whether it a day or. I mean\\n\\n39:41.834 --> 39:44.034\\nI tend to always just do days because then I can do it in my\\n\\n39:44.042 --> 39:47.522\\nlunch break. I can just like. But all you're doing at that point is like\\n\\n39:47.546 --> 39:50.978\\nyou're going into the planet, restarting the extraction and then coming out.\\n\\n39:51.034 --> 39:54.322\\nYeah. It. So that adding that button just saves so much\\n\\n39:54.346 --> 39:58.104\\ntedium. Like it doesn't, like, it doesn't change the gameplay in terms of like\\n\\n39:58.192 --> 40:01.352\\nhaving to make sure you move the extractors with the, with the hotspots and\\n\\n40:01.376 --> 40:04.600\\nthings. Just like let's just make a button that does it.\\n\\n40:04.720 --> 40:08.552\\nYeah. Like I don't care how perfect it is, just keep working machine.\\n\\n40:08.616 --> 40:11.816\\nYeah, exactly. I know it's not perfect. Just.\\n\\n40:11.888 --> 40:14.760\\nYeah. You already made the commitment to log in and interact in space.\\n\\n40:14.800 --> 40:17.340\\nYeah. So just like boop, boop,\\n\\n40:17.760 --> 40:21.458\\nboop. Indeed. There is one here.\\n\\n40:21.514 --> 40:24.882\\nSales tax increased from 4 to 7.5. People said\\n\\n40:24.906 --> 40:28.242\\nthat we kind of glossed over this one with all the. But we didn't like\\n\\n40:28.266 --> 40:32.210\\ntalk about it deeply. Why isn't tax going up? Tax is going\\n\\n40:32.250 --> 40:34.898\\nup because we're trying to fight inflation.\\n\\n40:34.994 --> 40:38.210\\nYeah. Essentially tax tax is one of the\\n\\n40:38.250 --> 40:41.122\\nlargest things that we have in the game.\\n\\n40:41.226 --> 40:44.642\\nIt's our biggest lever for how we, how we control the economy.\\n\\n40:44.826 --> 40:48.062\\nAnd so it's, we, we actually did lower it, I think get\\n\\n40:48.086 --> 40:50.930\\nwhen we. In July. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n\\n40:51.830 --> 40:55.854\\nSo now it's just like, okay, we've, we've understood the effects\\n\\n40:55.902 --> 40:59.534\\nof that. Let's pull that, pull that lever back and then\\n\\n40:59.622 --> 41:03.230\\nhopefully we can then like reduce the amount of inflation with just, just with that.\\n\\n41:03.270 --> 41:07.198\\nBecause it's, it's insane how much money is, is like\\n\\n41:07.254 --> 41:10.942\\npushed out of the economy through, through taxes. I've seen people debating it back\\n\\n41:10.966 --> 41:13.770\\nand forth and those who.\\n\\n41:14.740 --> 41:19.116\\nI've seen some people saying like it is very important to have healthy sinks\\n\\n41:19.148 --> 41:22.412\\nin the game as well. Yeah, yeah. So it's not healthy when, you know,\\n\\n41:22.516 --> 41:24.876\\ninflation gets to go rampant. Yeah.\\n\\n41:24.988 --> 41:28.524\\nSo that is the reasoning behind this. Yep. And the economic,\\n\\n41:28.612 --> 41:32.412\\nthe like, the, the decision to do this came from internally. It's known\\n\\n41:32.436 --> 41:35.916\\nas the EVE Economic Council. It's kind of just like a group of developers\\n\\n41:35.948 --> 41:39.388\\nand data scientists and just people\\n\\n41:39.444 --> 41:43.022\\nwith like an economy brain trying to decide, hey, like is\\n\\n41:43.046 --> 41:47.182\\nthis going in a healthy direction? What are the long term goals that we see?\\n\\n41:47.286 --> 41:50.702\\nWhen we lowered it, we wanted to do an experimentation to see like if the\\n\\n41:50.726 --> 41:54.030\\nvelocity would change and we kind of get similar numbers.\\n\\n41:54.190 --> 41:57.934\\nDidn't get the right returns we wanted. So just turn that back a little bit\\n\\n41:57.942 --> 42:00.958\\nlower than how it used to Be. Yep. But the back to how it was\\n\\n42:01.014 --> 42:04.170\\nfor, you know, I think five or six years now.\\n\\n42:05.110 --> 42:08.622\\nMercenary dents, they're going to be a little bit less effective at pumping out\\n\\n42:08.646 --> 42:09.650\\ninfomorphs.\\n\\n42:12.930 --> 42:16.490\\nConvict in the back yelling at it. That guy over there,\\n\\n42:16.530 --> 42:18.310\\nby the way. I'm going to bring it up.\\n\\n42:19.970 --> 42:23.322\\nOn patch day, we went out and we immediately put\\n\\n42:23.346 --> 42:26.378\\na bunch of MTOs out. Oh really? And then our group was like, okay,\\n\\n42:26.394 --> 42:29.930\\nyou can only have two each. And that mother truckers had\\n\\n42:29.970 --> 42:33.562\\nthree out the whole time. See, it's been doing like\\n\\n42:33.586 --> 42:37.498\\n50% more than me this entire time. But his.\\n\\n42:37.554 --> 42:41.730\\nHis cena got ganked in high sec the other day. So there is a God.\\n\\n42:43.990 --> 42:48.126\\nAnyway, they're going to be doing a little bit less when it comes to infomorph\\n\\n42:48.158 --> 42:52.110\\ngeneration. Were we getting too much? Like what was the. Because that sanitas\\n\\n42:52.190 --> 42:56.158\\naren't. They haven't dropped an insane amount. Yeah. They haven't become like other\\n\\n42:56.214 --> 42:59.662\\nbattle cruiser levels. What is the reasoning for like tweaking this a little\\n\\n42:59.686 --> 43:02.974\\nbit? So when it comes to this, it's much the same as\\n\\n43:03.062 --> 43:06.830\\nwhen we're looking at anything else. Like economically, we're just making\\n\\n43:06.870 --> 43:09.994\\nsure that we've got our finger on the pulse for these types of things.\\n\\n43:10.102 --> 43:13.346\\nAnd it's essentially just like we. We noticed there's. There's quite an increase\\n\\n43:13.418 --> 43:16.162\\nin the amount of infomorphs. Yeah. So we're just trying to see if we can\\n\\n43:16.186 --> 43:19.314\\njust pull that. Pull that down just a smidge. But yeah,\\n\\n43:19.362 --> 43:22.642\\njust. Just really just like making sure that the economy's in\\n\\n43:22.666 --> 43:25.954\\na healthier state. And just because haven't dropped doesn't\\n\\n43:26.002 --> 43:29.922\\nmean that people aren't sitting on a boatload of information. Exactly. Exactly. So there have\\n\\n43:29.946 --> 43:33.282\\nbeen people saving up quite a bit of them. And once people have\\n\\n43:33.306 --> 43:36.306\\ngotten the skills, they're only going to start pumping these things into ships.\\n\\n43:36.338 --> 43:39.692\\nYeah. So it's just a little touch up\\n\\n43:39.716 --> 43:44.988\\non how much they're giving people then.\\n\\n43:45.044 --> 43:48.828\\nWe have a ton of things about lowering\\n\\n43:48.924 --> 43:53.068\\nthe build price. Tac one Dreads battleships\\n\\n43:53.244 --> 43:55.600\\nand I think all capitals. Is that correct?\\n\\n43:56.420 --> 43:59.676\\nWe are definitely not going to read all of these things as we go through.\\n\\n43:59.748 --> 44:03.814\\nLet's talk about why are we doing this? Why are we making capitals?\\n\\n44:03.862 --> 44:08.010\\nAnd we're talking capitals being Attack one Capital. This is not Supers and Titans.\\n\\n44:08.670 --> 44:11.970\\nSo why are we making them cheaper to build?\\n\\n44:12.910 --> 44:16.438\\nWe are making them cheaper to build because we want more of them in space.\\n\\n44:16.574 --> 44:19.958\\nThe best answer you could give. We want. We want people to have fun\\n\\n44:20.014 --> 44:23.542\\nand we want people to blow stuff up. And I think in general\\n\\n44:23.646 --> 44:27.622\\nwe, like, we realized for a while that the\\n\\n44:27.646 --> 44:31.052\\nprice of these caps are quite high. Yep. And so really we just want\\n\\n44:31.076 --> 44:34.236\\nto look at like, okay, well let's bring that down.\\n\\n44:34.308 --> 44:37.612\\nLike, because I think in general, when you're looking at the risk. Risk reward of\\n\\n44:37.636 --> 44:41.100\\ndeploying caps, when you, when you're looking at a six and a half\\n\\n44:41.140 --> 44:44.920\\nbuild dread, it's like, that's actually quite a, you know,\\n\\n44:45.220 --> 44:48.588\\nquite a bit a significant thing to put onto the battlefield. And I think,\\n\\n44:48.644 --> 44:51.628\\nI mean, maybe less so for the, for the larger groups, but like when you're\\n\\n44:51.644 --> 44:55.132\\nthinking about sort of slightly smaller groups. Yeah. Like, it's an expensive asset to\\n\\n44:55.156 --> 44:57.602\\nput on the field. So if you can, if we, if we can just bring\\n\\n44:57.626 --> 45:00.994\\nthat down a bit, like, it makes the, the risk factor a\\n\\n45:01.002 --> 45:04.306\\nlittle bit less. Yeah, yeah. The Dreadman also kind of has shifted ever since we've\\n\\n45:04.338 --> 45:07.122\\nhad Navy Dreads to where like so many groups are saying,\\n\\n45:07.146 --> 45:10.898\\nokay, tech one Dreads, maybe for some Dread bombs,\\n\\n45:10.914 --> 45:14.530\\nbut we really want a lot of like Zurins and Navy Dreads to do these\\n\\n45:14.570 --> 45:19.042\\nlike huge knockdown fights that we've been seeing. And so just as\\n\\n45:19.066 --> 45:22.204\\nthat meta evolved, like, those ships became a little, quite a\\n\\n45:22.212 --> 45:26.012\\nbit more expensive, so those fights in general became more expensive. So being\\n\\n45:26.036 --> 45:29.548\\nable to like tie these down a little bit along with battleships,\\n\\n45:29.724 --> 45:33.580\\nit'll just make it so, you know, more groups, as you had said, Trash Panda\\n\\n45:33.660 --> 45:36.444\\ncan engage in this type of content. More individuals can,\\n\\n45:36.612 --> 45:39.564\\nand you know, they can have them a little bit more frequently as well.\\n\\n45:39.652 --> 45:43.084\\nYeah, for sure. And it's a pretty significant like 25% decrease in\\n\\n45:43.092 --> 45:46.520\\nbattleship build cost. It's huge. I mean, they've been,\\n\\n45:47.550 --> 45:50.950\\nthey've been too expensive to be worth roaming in\\n\\n45:50.990 --> 45:54.374\\nand doing things in compared to just again, their faction variants. Yeah,\\n\\n45:54.422 --> 45:58.694\\nyeah. There's not been enough of a gap there to be like justifiably\\n\\n45:58.742 --> 46:02.070\\nusing them. Yeah, absolutely. So I think this is also a really\\n\\n46:02.110 --> 46:06.182\\nhealthy step. There's a really big tab with all\\n\\n46:06.206 --> 46:09.782\\nthe capital components and how they're changing.\\n\\n46:09.846 --> 46:12.902\\nWe're definitely not going to dive into this. I'm still scrolling.\\n\\n46:12.966 --> 46:16.438\\nThere we go. Things are cheaper. Things are cheaper.\\n\\n46:16.534 --> 46:20.022\\nThumbs up. Combat Battle Cruisers and Attack Battle Cruisers have had\\n\\n46:20.046 --> 46:23.782\\ntheir reprocessing material up to date. Is this going to be affecting\\n\\n46:23.846 --> 46:28.022\\ntheir insurance payout or\\n\\n46:28.046 --> 46:30.998\\nis that a different thing? Am I reading it wrong? That's. That's a different thing.\\n\\n46:31.134 --> 46:34.758\\nYeah. The, the Battle Cruisers, they had this weird quirk\\n\\n46:34.854 --> 46:38.566\\nwhere the output for refining them wasn't\\n\\n46:38.598 --> 46:41.814\\nthe. Didn't match the input materials. Yeah. So they\\n\\n46:41.822 --> 46:45.530\\nwere refined really inefficiently. Gotcha. And it was just like\\n\\n46:45.630 --> 46:49.522\\nweird idiosyncrasy with those ships that we wanted to fix.\\n\\n46:49.666 --> 46:51.470\\nYeah, exactly. Fair enough.\\n\\n46:53.210 --> 46:56.866\\nAnd then we just have a bunch of little things showing\\n\\n46:56.898 --> 47:00.482\\nyour number of skill points in queue. How much do you\\n\\n47:00.506 --> 47:04.002\\nhave in that queue right there? How many injections would you need to\\n\\n47:04.026 --> 47:07.122\\nactually fill that stuff out? That's a pretty big one.\\n\\n47:07.226 --> 47:10.450\\nWhen I'm thinking of an alt that I'm trying to go over, I go back\\n\\n47:10.490 --> 47:13.314\\nto the skill and I look at it. Okay, it's like a 2 mil skill.\\n\\n47:13.442 --> 47:16.242\\nHow much SP do I have there and how much would I get for each\\n\\n47:16.266 --> 47:20.024\\none? And it's this, because I remember\\n\\n47:20.072 --> 47:23.720\\nhaving that ability on evemon. Remember the third party?\\n\\n47:23.840 --> 47:26.920\\nYeah. Like you could tell. It would tell you how many injectors you had for\\n\\n47:26.960 --> 47:30.712\\nlike you needed to fill out this skill plan. I think it's like we\\n\\n47:30.736 --> 47:33.960\\nshould just have that in our game. Of course it should exist. Existing.\\n\\n47:34.120 --> 47:37.416\\nYeah. State icons to drone windows.\\n\\n47:37.448 --> 47:40.856\\nI don't actually know what that is. So essentially with drones.\\n\\n47:40.968 --> 47:43.704\\nSo obviously you have the idle, engaging,\\n\\n47:43.752 --> 47:46.520\\nreturning. Yeah, I thought those were the state icons of what they're doing.\\n\\n47:46.560 --> 47:50.052\\nSo they are. They are like\\n\\n47:50.076 --> 47:53.800\\nthe status of. Of the thing itself, but just as an extra.\\n\\n47:54.700 --> 47:58.356\\nLike an extra, I don't know, like user experience.\\n\\n47:58.508 --> 48:02.836\\nWe've added in icons for attacking idle and\\n\\n48:02.988 --> 48:06.708\\nreturning. So they, they just. You just get that extra like\\n\\n48:06.764 --> 48:10.276\\ninformation to the, to the player that you can tell that this thing's attacking.\\n\\n48:10.308 --> 48:13.668\\nIt's like it's a red, red like sword or like a,\\n\\n48:13.724 --> 48:17.710\\nyou know, yellow returning symbol. And it's just like, you know,\\n\\n48:17.750 --> 48:21.054\\nextra information to. To the player for the drone window in general.\\n\\n48:21.142 --> 48:24.814\\nOkay. I think is like, obviously if you're. If you're a specific drone\\n\\n48:24.862 --> 48:28.126\\nship, you're paying so much attention to the drone window. But in general, if you're\\n\\n48:28.158 --> 48:31.758\\njust like. If you have a, you know, a set of drones on anything else\\n\\n48:31.774 --> 48:34.974\\nyou're doing, sometimes that information, what they're doing is. Is kind\\n\\n48:34.982 --> 48:38.206\\nof a bit like lost in the. In the eyes. And often you'll\\n\\n48:38.238 --> 48:40.702\\nhave like the drone window set up in a way where you just see their\\n\\n48:40.726 --> 48:43.970\\nhealth bars. Yeah, yeah. Are they being killed? Yeah. And you might not actually\\n\\n48:44.010 --> 48:47.350\\nrealize that you didn't click up and like they're just sitting there idle.\\n\\n48:48.330 --> 48:51.550\\nIt's painful. I feel called out right now.\\n\\n48:52.410 --> 48:55.298\\nI'm calling on myself. I've done this many times.\\n\\n48:55.434 --> 48:58.642\\nYeah, this is a good, good Thing\\n\\n48:58.666 --> 49:02.722\\nto be adding market orders are going to be by default\\n\\n49:02.786 --> 49:06.114\\nordered the way they should be. Sell orders\\n\\n49:06.162 --> 49:09.430\\nfrom lowest to highest and buy orders from highest to lowest. So people aren't.\\n\\n49:09.790 --> 49:13.318\\nYeah, they default them. Yeah, this is. Yeah, this is just.\\n\\n49:13.454 --> 49:17.530\\nShould have been there a while ago. Scammers currently in shambles.\\n\\n49:19.150 --> 49:22.502\\nYeah. Just some like cleanup of the market. And this was\\n\\n49:22.526 --> 49:25.846\\nalso in conversation with the CSM as well. These were things we're just like,\\n\\n49:25.918 --> 49:29.530\\nyeah, we should just fix those. Yeah. There's just like kind of a session.\\n\\n49:30.830 --> 49:34.022\\nI don't like to call it any specific dev. Yeah. But I'm going to call\\n\\n49:34.046 --> 49:37.322\\nout one specific dev where CCP Carco was just in the corner with like\\n\\n49:37.346 --> 49:40.298\\na little book of just like writing things down.\\n\\n49:40.354 --> 49:43.802\\nIt kind of just like I just imagine her just like going like this and\\n\\n49:43.826 --> 49:47.082\\njust smiling whenever they get into the game. Like one more\\n\\n49:47.106 --> 49:50.810\\nlittle thing down. Yeah. Especially with these little things\\n\\n49:50.850 --> 49:54.522\\naren't actually little things and they take like, they're a huge amount of time.\\n\\n49:54.626 --> 49:57.770\\nPretty big deals most of the time. Yeah. It's ironic to call them little\\n\\n49:57.810 --> 50:00.830\\nthings. Yeah. Yeah. But by orders.\\n\\n50:01.890 --> 50:04.970\\nI have this friend, we didn't know that if you\\n\\n50:05.910 --> 50:09.422\\nsell it, it will just sell at that price. Oh, no.\\n\\n50:09.526 --> 50:12.782\\nAnd I remember like we were debating. It's like, no, dude, if you sell it\\n\\n50:12.806 --> 50:16.462\\nat a certain price, you set up a sell order or,\\n\\n50:16.486 --> 50:20.078\\nsorry, a buy order, you're gonna buy it all at that expensive thing.\\n\\n50:20.134 --> 50:23.854\\nHe's like, no, no, no, no. I remember this conversation so vividly.\\n\\n50:23.902 --> 50:27.790\\nBut now it is gonna go down the line and pick and\\n\\n50:27.830 --> 50:31.600\\npay the correct amount for each one. This is a pretty good\\n\\n50:31.640 --> 50:35.168\\none. If you don't want to talk about, read the, the patch notes.\\n\\n50:35.264 --> 50:38.976\\nYou'll understand. Yeah. Also give Oz a poke. I think he'll be\\n\\n50:39.048 --> 50:42.352\\nsweating. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. With that,\\n\\n50:42.376 --> 50:45.776\\nwe're down to defect fixes. Well,\\n\\n50:45.848 --> 50:48.848\\nthere is the one more that I want to call out. Yeah, I'm super hyped\\n\\n50:48.864 --> 50:52.272\\nfor this one. You can now pin stations to the top of\\n\\n50:52.296 --> 50:55.804\\nyour personal assets. That's a good one. That is for me,\\n\\n50:55.912 --> 50:59.316\\nhuge. Because I've been. Been around in the game for a while.\\n\\n50:59.388 --> 51:02.880\\nI have a lot of trash and a lot of stations. Same.\\n\\n51:03.420 --> 51:06.932\\nWe can also hide assets. I don't think we refreshed this\\n\\n51:06.956 --> 51:09.972\\nbecause I'm pretty sure I put that in the patch notes earlier. Yeah, you can\\n\\n51:09.996 --> 51:12.388\\nnow hide assets. And I was like, why would you want to do that?\\n\\n51:12.524 --> 51:15.796\\nAnd then, oh yeah, we. We have trash everywhere, right? Yeah,\\n\\n51:15.828 --> 51:19.540\\nit's the sweeping under the Rug thing. Like I don't need to know about this\\n\\n51:19.580 --> 51:23.172\\nanymore. Yeah. I don't know that in stay. And I've got 15 ibises\\n\\n51:23.316 --> 51:25.320\\nand a micro warp drive somewhere.\\n\\n51:26.700 --> 51:29.894\\nGet rid of that. It's fin. Not right click destroy. No, no. Just hide it\\n\\n51:29.902 --> 51:33.238\\non. What if it becomes really valuable in the future? I got a.\\n\\n51:33.374 --> 51:36.854\\nI got a diamond hands. Just. It. It does feel\\n\\n51:36.942 --> 51:40.774\\nreally, really bad to have to trash like fairly\\n\\n51:40.822 --> 51:44.694\\ndecent stuff. Yeah. You know, I've got. I think I've got like\\n\\n51:44.862 --> 51:48.054\\n150 qua sat in a station that I can't access and it's like\\n\\n51:48.062 --> 51:52.118\\nI don't want to get rid of the qua. Like it's, it's, you know,\\n\\n51:52.254 --> 51:55.876\\nmight need it one day. Yeah. For our table. It's also\\n\\n51:55.948 --> 51:59.380\\nworth a fair amount. So I was just like, I don't want to. I don't\\n\\n51:59.420 --> 52:02.644\\nwant to kill it. But then I can just. I can hide it away and\\n\\n52:02.652 --> 52:06.052\\nthen. Then I never forget. I can forget about it.\\n\\n52:06.236 --> 52:10.292\\nThere's one thing in the defect fixes. Vorkel can vertical again.\\n\\n52:10.476 --> 52:13.812\\nHuge. It was. It was having some problems and\\n\\n52:13.836 --> 52:17.652\\nneeded blue pills to stand up. Yeah. So now it's. It's actually able\\n\\n52:17.676 --> 52:21.146\\nto go vertical again, which it needs to. Yeah. Whatever reasons.\\n\\n52:21.228 --> 52:24.990\\nYeah. I think we're going to take a tidy break. We're going to thank both\\n\\n52:25.030 --> 52:28.254\\nCCB Swift and CCB Trashpander for coming onto the show.\\n\\n52:28.342 --> 52:32.046\\nThank you. Discussing the patch notes, we're going to have two other devs\\n\\n52:32.078 --> 52:35.534\\ncome on. CCP Wonder and CCP Lumi. And we're going to talk about the Drifter\\n\\n52:35.582 --> 52:38.170\\ncrisis and what's been happening there.\\n\\n52:39.030 --> 52:42.350\\nBe back in two minutes. Welcome back.\\n\\n52:42.470 --> 52:45.886\\nI am still CCP, but now I have CCP Lumi and CCP\\n\\n52:45.918 --> 52:49.532\\nWonder. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you. How are you guys feeling today?\\n\\n52:49.716 --> 52:53.884\\nGood. All right. All right. Yeah. We were just talking\\n\\n52:53.932 --> 52:57.532\\nabout how CCP Wanderer is a little nervous because of all the things he has\\n\\n52:57.556 --> 53:00.604\\nin his head. Maybe he wants. It's all right being a little\\n\\n53:00.612 --> 53:03.080\\nnervous. Oh, goodness. Galaxy Brain. No,\\n\\n53:04.180 --> 53:07.932\\nI was just telling them that as a narrative designer, you have to constantly remember\\n\\n53:07.996 --> 53:11.452\\nwhat's been already officially announced to the players and\\n\\n53:11.476 --> 53:14.892\\nall the secrets we're keeping. And it's so terrifying\\n\\n53:14.956 --> 53:18.378\\nright now that I might slip something that's a spoiler.\\n\\n53:18.554 --> 53:21.962\\nSo, yeah, thankfully I don't have to. Be worried either because CCB Lumi is\\n\\n53:21.986 --> 53:25.322\\ngoing to lead the conversation with this one. There's a drifter crisis going\\n\\n53:25.346 --> 53:28.762\\non. What has happened so far? Well,\\n\\n53:28.946 --> 53:32.522\\nI know we're Supposed to talk about the Drifter crisis and especially the\\n\\n53:32.546 --> 53:36.282\\nrace for the hives that started yesterday. But I figured before we go into all\\n\\n53:36.306 --> 53:40.458\\nthat, we are going to take a little flashback to September last year,\\n\\n53:40.594 --> 53:44.664\\nbecause that is kind of why the Drifters reemerged\\n\\n53:44.722 --> 53:48.300\\nwhen we did the siege of Sarsac. Yeah. Can you explain\\n\\n53:48.380 --> 53:51.644\\nwhat prompted that? Spoiler, spoiler,\\n\\n53:51.692 --> 53:54.400\\nspoiler, spoilers. But basically,\\n\\n53:55.540 --> 53:59.320\\nsince a very, very long time,\\n\\n53:59.780 --> 54:03.244\\nthere's been something hiding in Zarzakh, and the Drifters\\n\\n54:03.372 --> 54:07.244\\ngot, like, some sort of hint\\n\\n54:07.292 --> 54:10.628\\nthat it might be there and maybe just\\n\\n54:10.724 --> 54:14.308\\nattacked en masse to kind of try to get to it. And that's what\\n\\n54:14.364 --> 54:17.540\\nyou're saying? Yes. And that's when we had the siege sites and\\n\\n54:17.580 --> 54:21.396\\nthe capsules responded and broke\\n\\n54:21.428 --> 54:24.500\\nthe siege, and all of that happened. And there was,\\n\\n54:24.540 --> 54:27.700\\nlike, the. The call for Adam and the reaction.\\n\\n54:27.780 --> 54:31.284\\nWell, I'm getting ahead of myself, but don't worry. I just have\\n\\n54:31.292 --> 54:34.644\\na little timeline here on the pad just so we can walk through all of\\n\\n54:34.652 --> 54:38.704\\nit that happened since then. So next up after that was, like, the shrouded\\n\\n54:38.752 --> 54:42.400\\nstructure that appeared. Yeah, yeah. Is that where you were going with Edaphone?\\n\\n54:42.480 --> 54:46.608\\nYes. And then basically, like, this new structure appears,\\n\\n54:46.784 --> 54:49.472\\nand the deathless is like, oh, we got to research this. And they put up\\n\\n54:49.496 --> 54:52.624\\na station. They're like, we need these new.\\n\\n54:52.712 --> 54:55.260\\nThis new tech that's been recently, like,\\n\\n54:56.040 --> 54:59.552\\ndiscovered because the world of Eve has, like, a ton of junk. Trash Panda is\\n\\n54:59.576 --> 55:02.912\\nprobably really happy about that. And that is kind of like, this prompts the\\n\\n55:02.936 --> 55:06.190\\nsudden detection of. Be able to see that. And.\\n\\n55:08.490 --> 55:11.650\\nYeah, so there was this big call. Bring us out of them. Right.\\n\\n55:11.690 --> 55:15.470\\nYeah, we kind of did that call through the\\n\\n55:15.770 --> 55:19.042\\nParada Okie soccer caravan, where we accidentally.\\n\\n55:19.106 --> 55:22.322\\nOr. Well, and we got shot. So it's not really by\\n\\n55:22.346 --> 55:25.554\\naccident. We dropped some of it. So we had puzzle pieces that kind of,\\n\\n55:25.562 --> 55:29.250\\nlike, hinted at there's going to be a group of people going through\\n\\n55:29.290 --> 55:33.030\\nthis area. We didn't get the exact coordinates, and we\\n\\n55:33.070 --> 55:37.010\\nkind of, like, obfuscated a bit, and that was\\n\\n55:37.630 --> 55:42.102\\nsome really clever stuff that was done there. But they\\n\\n55:42.126 --> 55:46.358\\nwere full of stuff to bring, and the capsulators intercepted\\n\\n55:46.374 --> 55:49.974\\nit. And that was the first time, I believe, that the. Out of them were\\n\\n55:50.062 --> 55:53.302\\nfound. That's when I came into the game. Yeah. Yeah. The Drifters are interesting as\\n\\n55:53.326 --> 55:56.776\\na. As a storyline that's progressing\\n\\n55:56.808 --> 56:00.792\\nbecause they're like this old thing that felt like it's been somewhat abandoned,\\n\\n56:00.936 --> 56:04.536\\nbut then they've kind of existed there in the background. I think, like a gap\\n\\n56:04.568 --> 56:07.688\\nof like 10 years. Exactly. A 10 year gap in a video\\n\\n56:07.744 --> 56:12.120\\ngame history of like these old enemies or this\\n\\n56:12.160 --> 56:15.960\\ngroup is now kind of reemerging. I do want to address one thing that people\\n\\n56:16.000 --> 56:19.384\\ntalk about, player. Like these events\\n\\n56:19.432 --> 56:23.026\\nthat we've used to. Used to have, we had the. The Guardian Gala\\n\\n56:23.058 --> 56:26.690\\nand the. The Hunt and all these events that were like seasonal.\\n\\n56:26.770 --> 56:30.354\\nYeah. We currently have stuff\\n\\n56:30.402 --> 56:34.162\\ngoing on with this Drifter crisis\\n\\n56:34.306 --> 56:37.682\\nthat these event teams are working on instead of the other\\n\\n56:37.706 --> 56:42.370\\nthings that we used to have before. And the Lore in\\n\\n56:42.410 --> 56:46.162\\nthese things kind of changes the universe way more than just like a\\n\\n56:46.186 --> 56:49.886\\none up events. Like Turner was a Lore event and Turner is\\n\\n56:49.958 --> 56:52.366\\nwildly different now than what it used to be before.\\n\\n56:52.518 --> 56:56.510\\nTabitha just had a thing happen the other week. Tabuture is\\n\\n56:56.550 --> 57:00.286\\nquite different now than it was the week before. There are things happening\\n\\n57:00.318 --> 57:03.610\\nand there are more things happening which we can't talk about,\\n\\n57:04.150 --> 57:07.246\\nbut we can maybe a little bit.\\n\\n57:07.398 --> 57:11.502\\nBut I think it's cool when we have the\\n\\n57:11.526 --> 57:15.012\\nevent teams not working on just one off events that kind of don't mean any\\n\\n57:15.086 --> 57:18.392\\nthing. Yeah. So where are we heading? Without giving a\\n\\n57:18.416 --> 57:21.480\\nspoiler. I mean, so on that timeline,\\n\\n57:21.640 --> 57:25.368\\nafter the shrouded structure and Edifam, we had a little break\\n\\n57:25.424 --> 57:28.520\\non the Drifter front and we did the Crimson Harvest and\\n\\n57:28.560 --> 57:31.300\\nthe Winter Nexus as we do as a seasonal event.\\n\\n57:32.080 --> 57:35.880\\nAnd then it was January. And in January the\\n\\n57:35.920 --> 57:39.432\\nDrifters came back full force. It was the. The start\\n\\n57:39.456 --> 57:42.558\\nof the Drifter crisis, which we hinted at again\\n\\n57:42.614 --> 57:45.566\\nwith little breadcrumbs here and there.\\n\\n57:45.638 --> 57:49.310\\nAnd also there. Was it a\\n\\n57:49.350 --> 57:52.510\\nchange in the deep flow Rifts. If anybody was paying like really close\\n\\n57:52.550 --> 57:55.838\\nattention, they would have noticed it. But that's\\n\\n57:55.854 --> 57:59.710\\nwhen they really came back in force to\\n\\n57:59.830 --> 58:03.406\\nkind of answer the kind of question\\n\\n58:03.478 --> 58:06.798\\nthere with the events. And we're going\\n\\n58:06.854 --> 58:10.146\\nmore in a direction where we pay attention to the players. Yeah,\\n\\n58:10.178 --> 58:13.938\\nright. Like, so what the Cap players do in the EVE universe,\\n\\n58:14.114 --> 58:18.194\\nwe want it to matter more. And that's why the event in Tabiture\\n\\n58:18.242 --> 58:21.858\\nhappened in Minmatar space. Correct. Because the Minmatar had\\n\\n58:21.914 --> 58:25.634\\ngotten furthest with the Drifter crisis. It could have been anywhere.\\n\\n58:25.682 --> 58:28.990\\nIt was a very stunning kind of like\\n\\n58:29.530 --> 58:33.106\\nreturn from. Because the Minmatar were doing badly at first. Yeah. And then like,\\n\\n58:33.178 --> 58:37.052\\nlike a combat story. They just. Yes, it was. And which is so\\n\\n58:37.186 --> 58:38.860\\nincredibly Vintar.\\n\\n58:40.160 --> 58:43.020\\nLike it was like, oh, on theme.\\n\\n58:44.160 --> 58:48.104\\nBut it could have happened for any of the interested.\\n\\n58:48.232 --> 58:51.384\\nWell, the four major factions. So whoever\\n\\n58:51.432 --> 58:54.888\\nwas responding more would have had a Tabatar like event. It just happened.\\n\\n58:54.904 --> 58:59.480\\nIt was The Minmatar that reacted the most to like, the Drifter crisis.\\n\\n58:59.640 --> 59:03.112\\nThat's why the event happened in their space. It's the Drifters being\\n\\n59:03.136 --> 59:06.604\\nlike, get back down. But now we're.\\n\\n59:06.652 --> 59:10.412\\nYou were talking about the timeline today. We had. Yesterday we\\n\\n59:10.436 --> 59:14.300\\nhad a reward track go live. Yeah. So things are progressing even more\\n\\n59:14.420 --> 59:18.412\\nand they're going to continue to. To grow. Is that correct again with what\\n\\n59:18.436 --> 59:21.628\\nthe. Capsuleers in the EVE universe are doing?\\n\\n59:21.684 --> 59:25.340\\nBecause in this event, you get to pick one of 10 factions.\\n\\n59:25.500 --> 59:29.196\\nYes. So this is very much. This is.\\n\\n59:29.268 --> 59:33.186\\nThis is a race. This is to gain access to technology\\n\\n59:33.338 --> 59:36.642\\nthat whoever doesn't get in the top five will not have\\n\\n59:36.666 --> 59:40.210\\naccess to. And we have some\\n\\n59:40.250 --> 59:42.430\\npreliminary results, which is.\\n\\n59:43.370 --> 59:47.666\\nWe're going to post them. I can't give you exact numbers\\n\\n59:47.778 --> 59:51.026\\nbecause they still, like, they're still processing.\\n\\n59:51.218 --> 59:54.498\\nAnd we need to make sure that we take into consideration the\\n\\n59:54.554 --> 59:57.836\\nharmonics properly.\\n\\n59:57.948 --> 01:00:01.916\\nBut right now there is an incredible showing by the Triglyvians\\n\\n01:00:01.948 --> 01:00:04.640\\nwho are first. Yeah. Like, wow.\\n\\n01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.720\\nSo the phrase for the Drifter hives,\\n\\n01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:13.260\\nwe've framed this as occupying the Drifter\\n\\n01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.972\\nholes, but we. People don't really know what that means.\\n\\n01:00:17.076 --> 01:00:19.628\\nYeah. So. But we can't also really talk about.\\n\\n01:00:21.796 --> 01:00:25.830\\nIs spiritual spoilers. Like, it is spoiler territory.\\n\\n01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:29.574\\nSo I. I can't say much. I'm just saying that it is worth it.\\n\\n01:00:29.662 --> 01:00:32.950\\nYeah, we're. We're gonna make it worth it that if you\\n\\n01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:36.806\\nend up in the top five, you know, you get something special.\\n\\n01:00:36.878 --> 01:00:39.366\\nSo I'm just gonna ask a question, and if you can't answer it, that's okay\\n\\n01:00:39.398 --> 01:00:43.350\\ntoo. But you were talking about the top five gets hidden tag.\\n\\n01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:47.450\\nWell, are they gonna find that in set Drift of wormholes?\\n\\n01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.080\\nI can't answer that question.\\n\\n01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:56.452\\nTotally fair. But what\\n\\n01:00:56.476 --> 01:01:00.436\\nwas surprising is we really expected that it would be like Triggs\\n\\n01:01:00.468 --> 01:01:04.340\\nfirst. We expected that with how popular they are. But like.\\n\\n01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.400\\nAnd people like the Trigs. And then after, it's the Amar,\\n\\n01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.892\\nwhich very strong community there. So we\\n\\n01:01:11.916 --> 01:01:16.194\\nalso expected them. And then after that, it's all really, really tight.\\n\\n01:01:16.332 --> 01:01:20.006\\nOkay. And in third place is the Angel Cartel.\\n\\n01:01:20.118 --> 01:01:23.494\\nOkay. Right. Yeah, no, this is exactly. We're like, oh,\\n\\n01:01:23.542 --> 01:01:27.766\\nokay. And then I think Galante,\\n\\n01:01:27.798 --> 01:01:31.270\\nCalderi, Minmatar. Yeah. And they're neck to neck.\\n\\n01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:35.398\\nIt's like if a group of people go and\\n\\n01:01:35.454 --> 01:01:39.158\\njust do a couple sites with those groups, they're actually affecting\\n\\n01:01:39.174 --> 01:01:42.980\\nthe needle here. Yes, absolutely. Cool. And. And then you got like the.\\n\\n01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.900\\nThe lesser known factions, but they're not out of the race already. Like, this is\\n\\n01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.324\\nfor Three weeks. So yeah, there's very high potential\\n\\n01:01:50.372 --> 01:01:53.160\\nfor like, comeback stories. Nice. That kind of stuff.\\n\\n01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:57.780\\nCool. Yeah. Where. Where are we heading now in the.\\n\\n01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.428\\nIn the next couple of weeks? Are things going to change more?\\n\\n01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:04.852\\nAre things going to get weirder or crazier or going to be. Is there\\n\\n01:02:04.876 --> 01:02:08.660\\nmore to come, really? Yes, absolutely. But for the next three weeks,\\n\\n01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:12.060\\nit's race for the highs. We're going to keep an eye on how the players\\n\\n01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:15.932\\nreact, what the players do. Yeah. And so\\n\\n01:02:15.956 --> 01:02:19.612\\nget involved. Go out there. If you care about one faction more than another,\\n\\n01:02:19.796 --> 01:02:23.276\\ngo help them. If you want them to occupy the Drifter halls,\\n\\n01:02:23.308 --> 01:02:27.068\\nwhatever that might mean, now is your time to go and do something\\n\\n01:02:27.124 --> 01:02:30.300\\nabout it. Yep. Yeah. And then in\\n\\n01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.880\\nthree weeks, we'll see what's next. Yes. Yes, we will.\\n\\n01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:38.358\\nI for one, am looking forward to it. Glad to hear it.\\n\\n01:02:38.494 --> 01:02:41.606\\nWe know there's a bunch of other things coming, but we can't really get into\\n\\n01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:44.582\\ntoo much detail. But we did want to raise awareness of and kind of get\\n\\n01:02:44.606 --> 01:02:47.430\\na status check on where we were with everything. Yeah.\\n\\n01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:51.462\\nBut keep a close eye on the New Eden News because that's where we're going\\n\\n01:02:51.486 --> 01:02:54.950\\nto be posting the, like, rankings. I think New\\n\\n01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:59.094\\nEden News is what hinted at Tabitur being attacked as well by the\\n\\n01:02:59.102 --> 01:03:02.260\\nMementar. If. If you like the narrative. New Eden News\\n\\n01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.196\\nis for you. Yeah. Cool. Keep an eye on New Eden News.\\n\\n01:03:06.268 --> 01:03:09.800\\nIs there anything else you'd like to add to this, to this segment?\\n\\n01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.884\\nBecause we gotta be. Yes. We just\\n\\n01:03:15.052 --> 01:03:18.580\\nwant to reiterate that we are paying attention to the players for\\n\\n01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:22.532\\nsure. And that we love it when people like\\n\\n01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:25.700\\ndo unexpected out of the box things with the narrative.\\n\\n01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.332\\nI still have very fond memories of the player that\\n\\n01:03:29.356 --> 01:03:33.572\\nbrought the camel tech geneticist to the Deathless\\n\\n01:03:33.636 --> 01:03:36.452\\nand they were able to like play with that.\\n\\n01:03:36.556 --> 01:03:40.148\\nSo just keep on engaging\\n\\n01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:43.732\\nwith the narrative.
