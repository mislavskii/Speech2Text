      "Speaker A: Good morning and welcome to Worldwide Wisdom. Folks. Today we're learning about a mission in this world which is to transform darkness into light. A mission in this world which is to transform chaos into chorus, dysfunction into clarity. God gives us darkness in order that we should turn it into light. That's an amazing transformation. You know, there's a story in the Talmud about one of the sages who was asked why it is that goats walk before sheep. Have you ever pondered this question?\n",
      "Speaker B: Absolutely, before I go to bed.\n",
      "Speaker A: Well, now you get ready for the answer. You ready? This is it. Just get a set, put it to bed.\n",
      "Speaker B: It's a bad answer.\n",
      "Speaker A: So here goes. Good morning, Stacy. So here goes. Why is it. I mean, can you imagine the Talmud, the. The second most important book of Judaism dealing with this? So why do the goats walk in front of the sheep? And the answer given was that the sage responded that go. Now, I don't know this, but goats apparently are darker and sheep are lighter. I know that sheep are white. This I know, but goats are dark. Okay. That the dark goats precede the light sheep, just like nights preceded day. That was the answer. That's why the goats walk in front of the sheep. What this means is that you're going to be born into a life which is dysfunctional in order for you to fix it. That's what it means. What a liberating idea. Did I say something to offend you folks? Bear with me, understand? Rob, take this in for a second. Is that you're born into a broken world so you can fix it. There's no purpose for us being in a perfect world. We were placed into this world in order that we should fix it. And here Hasidic introduces us to us to a life, life changing concept. It's on page 225 in the Hasidis books. It's right here behind me, this book. We're in this discourse of Hasida Subhanukah called Mitzvah Mishatishka Achama, delivered by the Rebbe in 1977, where the Rebbe quotes a gemara from Bava Mitziya 85A. And there the Gemara says something unbelievable. It's like an unbelievable statement. It tells us how we can overrule God. Isn't that interesting? How you can overrule God? Would you want to find out how you can make God do stuff that he doesn't want to do?\n",
      "Speaker B: Get him to change his mind.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay, get him to change his mind. Fair enough. How do you get God to change his mind? By doing something well, that's not. It says in the Gemara. Let me tell you what it says. Take a look. It's page 225. The Gemara says above him, but see 85A, that whoever takes the son of an ignoramus and teaches him Torah, no matter what God has decreed, will be transformed according to the intention of that person. So the Gemara says, I'm on page 225 at the top, top of the page. Take a look at this idea. At the top of 225. We can see that the transformation of the darkness into light is God's ultimate desire. From the following Talmudic passage. The Talmud says, whoever teaches Torah to the son of an unlearned person, that's an ignoramus. Even if God has made a negative decree, he will nullify it for his sake. This is the meaning of the verse. Quote. This verse comes From Jeremiah, chapter 15. What is the mean, the meaning of the verse? He who takes the precious out of the disgrace, that means the Torah scholar out of the ignoramus, according to him shall it be. It shall be. According to him it shall be. What does that mean? The Talmud's interpretation of this verse is not its literal meaning. On a simple level, the word kafi, according to him means like my mouth, like God's mouth. But Hasidis is interpreting this to mean the verse in Jeremiah. He who takes the precious out of the disgrace, he who makes about teshuvah a penitent out of a sinner, according to him it shall be. According to the Mentor, it shall be. That's how Hasidis interprets this verse. That's how. It's not only Hasidis. I mean, that's how the Talmud interprets the verse. The Talmud is saying that if you are able to affect novelty, if you can transform darkness into light, ignorance into inspiration, an atheist into a scholar, Torah scholar, sage. If you can do that, then according to him, it shall be. According to the intention, according to the desire of the mentor shall events unfold. That's how the Gamara and Baba Mitzia interprets this verse in Jeremiah that if you want to overrule God, what do you have to do? If you want to affect. If you want to overrule God, you have to. You have to transform darkness into light. You have to transform ignorance into inspiration.\n",
      "Speaker B: That's contrary to what we say on Yom Kippur. We say Toshuva to Feelah doesn't say anything about teaching.\n",
      "Speaker A: Hang on. So let me get, Let me get that in a moment. Before. Before you challenge me, I just want to explain the logic here. Not really. I want to make sure that I. I process your challenge, but only after I am properly explained what we're talking about over here. Jennifer from Israel, very nice to have you here. Type K. Yes. This is taped. It's on YouTube.com forward/jewishgardens with all of our other classes. And this is light. Well, okay, yes. I'm not sure if you're with us now or you're with us later. This might be quantum mechanics. You might be here or there and. And both at the same time. But hey, we're good. Okay, so let's explain in the logic of this what the rev is going to explain. And we might not have time to reach that today. We probably won't. But I just want to develop this transformational idea. What the Rebbe is about to explain is that God put us in this world in order to affect a novelty. Remember we said we learned previously in this series that how do you make God laugh? Power washing somebody? Power washing. How do you make God laugh? We learned this previously by. By what?\n",
      "Speaker B: Tell him your plan.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay, so that's the colloquialism I mentioned. TR and God. L. Man plans and God laughs as if to say that God has other intentions that we're not aware about. But we've learned that what makes a joke funny is a punchline. What's a punchline? A punchline is an unexpected ending. Right? An unexpected ending. And that's what we learned. That God desires us to make him laugh. We learned that in the previous class here in page 224, that God wants us to surprise him. He wants us to. To make a novelty. To make something unexpected. To take a dysfunctional situation and turn it into function. To turn an abusive childhood and turn it into a functionality parenting or a functional marriage. Now that isn't easy when you've got deep, deep, deep traumas and wounded attachments. And now suddenly you've got to have a healthy relationship with a spouse or. Or children or parents. It's not easy. It's. It's going to take you digging, diving into the very depths of your being, into the basement of your soul in order to have the courage to face your demons and to somehow find the strength and the courage and the direction and the path and the mental mentorship to be able to find your way. But you know, there are people out there that can help you. There are therapists, there are rabbis, there are books. There's are shining light in the darkness but if you can do that, then what you've done is that you've made God laugh. You've given God both pleasure and laughter. And now Hasidis applies this to a. To a very empowering part of our lives where we. Where Hasidis is quoting this Gemara that says the Gemara doesn't really make so much sense. Like. Like Rob challenged me. Like it says in the Yom Kippur liturgy. Prayer, sorry, penitence, prayer and charity. They avert the evil decree. Suddenly the Gemara gives us a curveball. The Talmud says in Baba Mitziho, actually, if you teach the enigmas Torah, you take a kid out of public school and you start teaching him Torah right now, suddenly you're going to be able to overrule God and to cause the. The result to be the way you want it to be. What does this even mean? Hasidis is going to explain to us in this particular chapter, and again, we might not finish it inside, but allow me to at least explain it orally, that God wants us to give him a novelty. And how does he reward a novelty that we give him? By giving us a novelty. That's what it means. Measure for measure. When we give God a result which was unexpected, we turn the ignoramus into a scholar. You take a kid who was raised by two communist parents who's in public school and is getting zero Jewish education, and somehow you manage to inspire this child to love Torah and mitzvahs, then now what happens? You've effected a novelty in. In the universe, and as a result of that, God rewards you with the novelty and says, hey, you know, you weren't actually supposed to be a gazillionaire, but that's what's gonna happen. You weren't actually supposed to survive this illness, but actually that's what's gonna happen. You weren't supposed to mend the relationship with your son, but that's actually what's going to happen. Where through teaching Torah to an ignoramus, you're affecting a novelty that is going to result in you experiencing a novelty as well. Because God wants us to make him laugh, and when we do that, then he makes us laugh. Now, I want to just respond to your point, Rob, which is a very valid point, that it doesn't say this in the Good Book of the High Holidays. You're right. I would think that the reason is because on Rosh Hashanah Kipper, we're talking about the Day of Judgment, we're talking about law and order, we're talking about, what is it that's going to take at this very, very late stage in the game? You're already in the court. That's the question is what's it going to take to. Well, no, it's at this early stage in the game. Let me say that at the early stage in the game, the decree has not been made yet. It's pending. The decree is pending. You're in the appeals court. Remember Rosh Hashanah, that's it's written and in Yom Kippur, it's sealed. So whilst you're appealing your case, what is it that you can do in order to mitigate the severity of the decree to shua? Penitence, prayer and charity, all these three are are able to curry God's grace. However, the question is, what happens if you've already been the creed? It's already too late. The ship sailed already. The plane left it to the the airport. Let me just finish my sentence. So once the plane already left and the train already left the station, the decree has already been submitted and issued. Do you have any, any, any choice? If the bullet has already left the gun, are you able to control that? That's the novelty of the Gemara here. So I'm at an entirely different scenario where it's already out of the gate and you still have the power to be able to change it. Because remember, God is almighty. So when you give God a novelty, then God gives you a novelty as well. I hope that answers your question. What was your question?\n",
      "Speaker B: My question is if God decreases a negative decision to you by doing mitzvah and repentance, you could change that decision.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay, so you're suggesting, proposing that if you received an evil decree and then you decided to repent. Right. Then that should be the same effect.\n",
      "Speaker B: I'm saying that God will change the negative decree.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay, I don't disagree with that in the slightest bit, I think. Would God change your decree if you did teshuva? I would think so. Why not? In fact, that's probably the right answer to this question. Because you're saying teshuva is what we're talking about. What is teshuva? Teshuva means changing course. That's what teshuva means, repentance. I was going down this way and I'm going down that way. Now, whether you apply that to my own spirituality, where I'm changing course of my own spirituality, or if I'm inspiring someone else to change their spirituality, what's the difference? Either way, it's the same Thing. So I think all three of us are saying exactly the same thing. To shuma, this is. To shuma means to redirect. Right? That's what it means. Got it.\n",
      "Speaker B: So in your case, it's going to take years to take that kid from no knowledge to some knowledge.\n",
      "Speaker A: Okay, why? God already decreed, first of all, why is it going to take yours? How long is a piece of string? My friend, you can't take a kid.\n",
      "Speaker B: Who knows nothing and teach you everything in two minutes.\n",
      "Speaker A: You're exaggerating. It's not two minutes or, or decades. I mean, they could be, you know, it could be a day. You know what I want to tell you? I want to tell you my own experience, Steve, in my own experience, it's entirely possible that you spending time with a teenager who's deeply steeped in drugs, and when you're able. Or in some other addiction, and when you're able to touch his heart and they experience a breakdown of tears and they choose, they make the choice to reroute. That right there is teshuva. So it doesn't mean that he's emerging as a Torah scholar necessarily. Maybe he's making the decision to be. To. To start studying. I wouldn't put a time limit on it, is what I'm saying. I just want to thank you, Myers, who gifted a Rabbi David Vigla membership. I'm not sure what that is, but it sounds nice. Is Rabbi Vigla speaking to a class or his staff in the room? I'm speaking to our daily millionaires. This is our. My core group. This is the foundation of our community. And they, in their graciousness, have allowed me to share this class with worldwide wisdom.\n",
      "Speaker B: Andy, how is it even possible to surprise God?\n",
      "Speaker A: I mean, this whole thing sounds impossible to surprise God. Okay.\n",
      "Speaker B: In the future or. He knows your punchline.\n",
      "Speaker A: How is it possible to surprise God? Let's talk about this a second. You know, the Gemara, the. Sorry, the Hasidis is going to tell us over here in a second like this. Going to tell us a story. I'm going to do this orally. Just I'm not going to have time into it inside. Can you give us two examples to tell us a story about. About the debate in the Talmud which took place in Mode Cotton? No, it was actually in. In baba mitsiya, not 1559 B. It's a debate the sages were having with. The sages were debating a tanurushalachnai. It's called, you know, there's laws of purity and impurity which Is way beyond the pale of this conversation. But generally speaking, when a rodent, a rodent is an impure creature. When a rodent falls into a closed space, then everything in that closed space becomes impure as well. Right. So what happens if a rodent, dead, like a dead rodent, falls into an oven? Right. Then everything in the oven is impure, which is a huge problem for people that were living on limited budgets. Right? That was a problem. The debate right now is about which means an oven that's made out of cylinders, like tires. Cylinders. Right, cylinders. So what happened was that. Let me see if I can find this kumara, whatever was that, Because I'd like to read it to you folks. Just bear with me a moment as I find this helmet. I'll keep on talking. So the question was here, the question was about this oven made out of cylinders, Whether it was considered one big space or each cylinder is its own space. In other words, does the rodent impurify only what's in that cylinder space or the entire oven? Is it one unit or is it much more than one unit? Okay, well, yeah, okay, so you get a technical. But yeah, I mean, you get, you get the picture here. All right, so let's see what happens here. Here, here, here. Here it is. I'm just going to read you the pieces. This piece of Tomo just now, you remember your question? Your question was, does God know everything? Right? Yeah. Does God know the future? The following mission alludes to an incident in which a tana was offended. After quoting the mission, the gmail relates to incident we have learned in a mission, if someone cuts section. Cut sections for an oven and put a sand between the sections to cement them together. And the oven then came in contact with impurity, just like cylinders stacked up. Rebelaza declares that pure, but the sage has declared it impure. And this is the oven of the coiled serpent because it looks like a serpent, Right? What is meant by the coiled serpent in the name of Shmuel? It means that they, the sages surrounded the oven with discussions like this coiled snake. And then they declared it susceptible to impurity. So they surrounded it like a snake with a man of arguments. On that day, Rabbi Lazar advanced all the arguments in the world to defend his ruling why it's pure. But the sages did not accept his arguments. Rebel Azar said to them, if the law accords to me, Rabbi standing up to the entire talmudic assembly, and he says, if the law is according to me, let the carob tree prove it. Okay, what are you thinking, sir? Whereupon the carob tree was uprooted from its place and moved 100AMOs. That's like 200ft. Imagine watching a carob tree just like. Like, whoa. I mean, that's. That's impressive, man. Respect, right? And some say it was 400ammos, which is 800ft. Unconvinced, the sages said to him they were not impressed. You cannot bring proof from a Carib tree. Carib trees don't resolve Talmudic arguments. In other words, since he was a righteous man, the tree might have. Might, might have been uprooted at his command. This does not prove, though, that his ruling was correct. It just means that he was a spiritual pious sage. He then said to them, if the Lord quotes to me, then let the water canal prove it. Whereupon the water in the canal for flowed backward. Can you imagine watching water flow backward upstream?\n",
      "Speaker B: I would trust him.\n",
      "Speaker A: You'd be like, dude, I'm impressed, okay? The sages said to him, sorry, Charlie, not happening. You cannot bring proof from a water canal. Water canals are good, but they're not rule. He then said to them, if the Lord quotes to me, let the walls of the study hall prove it. Whereupon the walls of the study hall leaned and were about to fall. I mean, this is like a threat. Now they're inside.\n",
      "Speaker B: Okay?\n",
      "Speaker A: Immediately, Rabbi Yeshua rebuked the walls because Rebellious said, the walls cave in. I mean, he was maybe getting ready to lose his temper, right? I'll show you a different sage. Rebuke the walls. And he said to them, if Torah scholars vie with one another in discussions in Jewish law, what business is it of yours? Mind your own business. He said to the walls. The walls did not fall out of respect for Rabbi Yahushua, because he told them not to, but neither did they write themselves back up straight out of respect for Rebellious, who told them to fold, to cave in. And they still continue to lean to this day. There's apparently a yeshiva somewhere in. In Babylon and Iraq with walls that are somewhat crooked because of this debate. Okay? Rebellious then said to the sages, if the law according with me, let heaven prove it. He's getting serious. Okay, you don't want canals. You don't Carib trees. I'll bring you heaven. The heaven prove it. Whereupon a heavenly echo went forth and proclaimed. A heavenly voice declared, what argument do you have with Rabb Eliezer, whom the law follows in all places? I mean, seriously, is that not good enough for you? A heavenly voice. Upon hearing this, Rab Yeshua stood up on his feet and Declared the Torah is not in heaven. The Torah is not in heaven. Very nice that God agrees with you. Very impressed. But sorry, the Torah is not in heaven. What does it mean, it's not in heaven? Instead of Yumia, it means that we pay no heed to a heavenly echo in matters of Jewish law, for the Torah is given to man in Mount Sinai. Okay, okay. So what happens in the end? Rabbi Nastan once met Elijah at the end. Rabbina said to Elijah, what was the Holy One, blessed be he, doing at that moment? He asked him, remember that time when the heavenly voice came out and the sages overruled Rabi Eliezer and they decided to rule with the sages overruling God? What happened in heaven? What was he asked Elijah? It's a good question, right? What was God doing at that time? More than that, what was what the Holy one, blessed be doing at that moment? Rabbi show rejected the heavenly signal. Elijah responded to him. He, the God, godly one, was smart, was laughing and saying, my children have prevailed over me. My children, they have prevailed over me. Now, let me be clear. A Reform Jews use this piece of Talmud to say that God has a vote, but not a veto. They completely bastardized this piece of Talmud to say that God no longer has any power over us and we can make up our own Torah. We can create God in the image of man. We no longer need to be man created in the image of God. So there's an absolute problem with how they misinterpret that piece of Talmud. It's a very sensitive piece of Talmud where effectively we're learning it in the proper context right now. The way it's taught in Hasidis is that of course God wrote the Torah and God tells us what he wants in the Torah. However, when it comes to the Oral Torah, you know, we have the written Torah, you have the Oral Torah, right? So the written Torah is explicit, but you got to do what it says. You can't say, well, actually, we decided to cancel Shabbos because we don't like Shabbos anymore. We want to do Shabbos once a month, right? You can't do that. You can't overrule God. That's absurd. When it comes to the Oral Torah, there's three parts to the Oral Torah as we're learning in our current JLI course. There's the received Oral Torah, which is what Moses was given in Mount Sinai direct from God. Orally, there is the derived rl Torah, which is how the sages use the thirteen principles of Divine exegesis in order to extract and come to conclusions using adjacencies and contradictions and, and confluences and similar words and different principles of divine exegesis to come to conclusions. And finally there's legislative law. So there's received oral law, there's derived oral law, and there's legislated oral law. When it comes to the last two derived oral law, which is this case where the sages are deriving a law from the Torah based on principles of. Of. Of divine exegesis, that's when God can't tell us what to do because God already put it in our hands for us to derive the law is based on. On. On. On the principles that God has given us. You know, we say this in the Hodu, just before Hodu in the morning prayer when we, when we daven in the morning, we say right, right before we start the. For the Hodu in the morning, we say page 25. In the sitter, Rabbi Shmuel says the Torah is expounded by means of 13 rules. It's on page 25. We should review them. Right? These are different rules from a fortiori. Arguments from, from similar words, whatever. Different rules, Right. So that's what the Talmud is talking about. But the idea that I'm sharing with you from this piece of Talmud, the idea I'm sharing from you here is that God wants us to overrule him. God wants to be overruled. So even though Andy, Even though Andy, God says to us, God knows everything. He still wants us. He knows, he knows what we. He knows what we're going to rule because he knows the future, knows the past, everything. Right? But still he wants us to, in this beautiful illustration, to actually overrule them. There's one more story which we're going to come across later.\n",
      "Speaker B: But the point is he's not surprised.\n",
      "Speaker A: There's one more story. Well, okay, look, there's one more story here. You will be surprised where when it comes to, you know, today we use the Jewish calendar because Hillel gave us a Jewish calendar that sets every date in, in the future of Jewish history forever. We all, we know what when Rosh Hashanah is going to be in the year 2826. Because there's a calendar, the set calendar with a set cycle. But before Hillel set that calendar in motion, it was on the testimony of two witnesses that they would decide whether or not this month at 30 days or, or 29 days. That's how they figured it out. It was based on the, on the testimony of two witnesses. In other words, if you, if you had to advertise a wedding to your friends on the third day of the month, that was very, very difficult. That would be very confusing. You'd have to say Monday. Because on the third day of the month could be Monday, it could be Tuesday, depending on. It could be Sunday, depending on when the testimony of the witnesses was accepted. It says in the Talmud. It says in the Talmud we're going to learn this later that God ask and the angels descend down to the earthly courts to find out when they have established is going to be the new moon. So we're going to work through these concepts of how God wants us to take initiative, how God wants us to find a way to. To find a way to surprise him. Let's develop this idea. We ran out of time, but let's develop this idea how God wants us to surprise him. And suffice it to say that when we surprise God, then God surprises us. And that's the meaning of the Talmud, of this is how you can change God's decree by us inspiring an ignorant Jewish person, right by us teaching Torah to somebody who knows no Torah. It's then that God empowers us to say, you know what? I'm going to give you also what you did not expect a beautiful theme to develop, all tying into the same pro, the same construct, the same flow of the Hanukkah candles whose purpose is to illuminate the darkness they lit in the dark because they're there to eliminate the darkness. Our mission in this world is to write the ship is to fix the dysfunction.\n",
