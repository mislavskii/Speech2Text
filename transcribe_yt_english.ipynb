      "Speaker A: Good morning and welcome to World Wide Wisdom. The story of Purim is actually a story of modern times. You're not talking about any overt miracles. You know what's deafening about Purim story is that the silence is deafening when it comes to the miracle. Like, what was the miracle of the Purim story? There wasn't any. There was no miracle that was explicit and overt in the Purim story. Because. Because Purim is just an unfolding of events. It's a. An unlikely palace intrigue where it just so happened to be this way, just happened to be that way, and something else. And the queen was there at the right time, at the right place. Bim bam. The Jews were saved. Purim is the hidden hand of God as opposed to other miracles which were explicit, clear and unmistakable. Now, if you've. Most people are familiar with the Purim story as the following executive summary, where Haman tried to commit genocide against the Jews. Queen Esther was in the palace, right? Mordechai had something to do with it. She. She appealed to the king. And what happened was that the king had a change of heart and he hung Haman instead of Mordecai, and they lived happily ever after. That's pretty much the executive summary of Purim. But let's go behind the scenes today with the Talmud. Let's understand the backdrop of the Purim story to understand what really was going on behind the scenes. Because really what was happening back then was one of the most unsettling eras of Jewish history. You see, several decades prior to the Purim story, the Jewish people were the zenith of their power. Zenith means the heights, right? They were the zenith of their power zenith. In English, in South Africa, we say zebra anytime. I don't pronounce something properly. I said that's how we said in South Africa. Okay? So. So there were the zenith of their power. What happened? What happened? Moses had led the Jewish people out of Egypt. The year was 2,448. Since creation, they received the Torah that same year. Forty years later, they entered the promised land in the year 2488. Then, since creation, right? Then they spent about 500 years through the era of the Judges. You know, you've heard of Samson, you've heard of, you know, the various prophets, the Vora and so on and so forth. They went through the various prophets, sorry, the Judges, until eventually they ran into the ear of the Kings, where the prophet Samuel anoints King Saul the first king of Israel, who then anoints king? King David. Sorry, King David. I said right King David. And then the son of King David is King Saul. Now King Saul is the one. Sorry, King Solomon, Forgive me. King Solomon, take it slow. King Solomon. He's the one who builds the first temple which lasts for 410 years if I'm not mistaken. Until the arrival of the Babylonians, the Iraqis. The Iraqis, they come under the leadership of the brutal tyrant Nevucha Netzer and his and his bloodthirsty butcher General Navuz Radan. And they massacre the Jews. They destroy the first temple. It is, it is the lowest moment in Jewish history. The survivors are then taken captive into Babylon where Babylon is where the Jews are now. Now the one, the good part, the good news, the bad news was that everything was destroyed and the people were killed and the temples was destroyed in the land was exiled and so on and so forth. But the good news was a chilling prophecy by the prophet Jeremiah. Now Jeremiah was a prophet then. When he spoke, people listened. Why was that? Because he was the one who initially foretold the doom of Jerusalem. He was the one who had prophesied years earlier that if the Jews don't repent, then the, the king will come from the north, he said, and he will destroy Jerusalem and take you all captive and so on and so forth. So when people saw the unfolding of the prophecies of Jeremiah, they understood that this guy really was legit and he knew what he was talking about. While they were being exiled out of Jerusalem, he came up with another prophecy. And what that prophecy was 70 years. He came up with the 70 year prophecy that 70 years after the fall of Jerusalem, God will remember Jerusalem and she will be rebuilt. So they knew that they were on a limited time in exile. Now this was comforting to the Jews and devastating to their oppressors because their oppressors understood that this guy Jeremiah knew what he was talking about and therefore they were all very afraid of the 70 year prophecy. The problem was that the prophecy was vague and ambiguous. It was not clear about when the times began, the 70th time began. And that's the Gemara, the Talmud that I'd like to share with you which is the inside the backstory behind the scenes of the Purim story. Because remember, the Purim story begins with this wild feast of akaKashversh in the third year of his reign. We don't know why he was making a feast. The Taliban now is going to share with us the backdrop to that story and the various erroneous calculations that the say that the, the, that the kings, the Oppressors of Israel made when they. When they were celebrating this feast. So let's take a look at the story. Okay. In those Days by Yamim. This is the second verse of the Megillah. In those days when the king sat. So the Megillah opens up from Ethiopia to India. That's quite a distance. 127 provinces. When the King Sat is the second verse of the Megillah. What does it mean that he sat? It would mean that it was the beginning of his rape. But then it continues to say that it was in the third year of his reign that he sat. Why was he sitting comfortably on his throne only in the third year of his reign? What happened in the first two years? Rava said. Rava said. What is the meaning of when he sat? It was after his mind was put at ease. The Gemara we're learning, by the way, is Gemara Megilla, which is the Megillah purim. It's folio 11B. In case you'd like to follow inside. After his mind was put as was put at ease in the third year with regard to the fate of his Jewish subjects, he celebrated with the great feast. Why would it happen? The prophet Jeremiah foretold that the Jews would be redeemed from their Babylonian exile after 70 years. QUOTE Jeremiah, chapter 29, verse 10. For thus said God, when seven years are completed for Babylon, I shall remember you to return you to this place. However, Jeremiah did not clarify how these 70 years would be calculated. Each of the Gentile kings who ruled the Jews in this exile was aware of Jeremiah's prophecy and with a great anxiety awaited the deadline. Each according to his own calculation. Thus the passing of those 70 years with the Jews still. Thus the passing of those 70 years of the Jews still a subject nation, was caused for celebration. So any king who. Who was ruling over the Jews at that time and who, according to his calculation, felt that the 70 years that passed was a reason for celebration. And this is the introduction of the McGillah's opening scene. Why was it that in the third year of the reign of Akashversh, he suddenly felt comfortable upon his throne? Because. Because now he felt that the 70 years had come and gone. And this was reason to celebrate because he had calculated the years of 70 years had finished. Now let's take a look into it. He said Belshazzar was the former king of Babylon. The king ruled before, remember? I'll explain to you in a moment what happened. Okay, so. So what happened was Babylon conquered Jerusalem, but Babylon didn't last very long. It lasted about 52 years. The, the kingdom, the. The kingdom of Babylon last about 52 years after the fall of Jerusalem when until it was it was conquered by Cyrus and Darius the Persians and the Medes together. The Pers. The Persians and the Medes they made an alliance together to conquer Babylon. And that was the end of the Babylonian empire. The the Persian and Median empire then united under Akashverosh. Right. So there's a series of kings which I'll explain to you in a few minutes. Okay so just bear with me a moment. Okay, so Bill Shots are he. So he said that the former king of Babylon of the previous empire heard he calculated the 70 years of exile. But he erred in his calculation. However, I calculated the seven years concluding that now in the third year of my reign they are complete and I have not erred in my conclusion. So there's already, you see there's two kings, two calculations. And you'll see this Belshazzar also made a feast, a very famous feast that you'll learn about in a few moments. So, so what happened with Bel Shots. But now just give you a timeline. Was the first king of Babylon, right? His son was evil. Mirada ruled in the years 3319 from creation until 3363 from creation. So remember when the Jews came out of Egypt it was 2448. Almost a thousand years later. Because remember they took about 500 years to to until they built the temple and then the temple lasted about 410 years, right? So it's about a thousand years after they come out of Egypt. 3319 was the beginning of the rule of Nar. Until 3363 he destroyed Jerusalem. His son whose name was Evil. That was actually his name Evil, but didn't speak English. It didn't matter. He ruled from 3363 until 3386. His son, which would be the third king of Babylon was Belshazzar who ruled from 3386 until 3389. Just for three years until he was defeated by Darius the Mede and Cyrus of Persia. Okay. The one who ruled after them was Akashversh. Now what was be reckoning and how did he err? As it's written in the prophecy, when 70 years are completed for Babylon I shall remember you. That's Jeremiah 29:10. This one one sentence terrified empires. When. When Jeremiah had said that prophecy on the way out of Jerusalem. And it is written to complete the 70 years from the ruins of Jerusalem. That's a. It's a separate verse. That verse comes from Daniel. Right. Belshazzar understood that the 70th of Babylon mentioned in the first verse commenced with the ascension of the first Babylonian to the throne. So he. So there was. When seven years are completed for Babylon, I shall remember you. And there's a second verse that says to complete the 70 years from the ruins of Jerusalem. So the question is, when do you start counting the seven years? From the rise of Babylon or from the fall of Jerusalem? They weren't at the same time. So Belshazzar understood that the 70 years were related to the rise of Babylon. And therefore he Therefore calculated the 70 years as follows. The 45 years of Navuchad Netzar's reign, the first Babylonian Emperor and the 23 years of evil Miradock's reign and 2 years of his own reign makes up 70 years since the founding of the kingdom of Babylon. He figured it was 70 years. The prophecy was a prophecy that was 70 years. Time limit, expiration date to the kingdom of Babylon. And that's why at the end of second years of his own reign, he felt. Or the second year of his reign, he felt. That's it. The seven years have come and gone. The Jews are still not back in Jerusalem. The Jewish God must be dead since the Jews are still on the foreign domination. Under the passage. After the passage of these 70 years, both shots are concluded that Jeremiah's prophecy had been nullified. He therefore brought out the plundered vessels of the holy temple and used them at a great banquet attended by his nobleman. Anybody know what happened at that feast? No, no, no. You're talking about mixing feasts. This is Belshazzar's feast of the Babylonian. You're mixing your emperors. Right. That was the beginning. This story happened a couple years before the Purim story began. This is the feast of Belshazzar that you'll see why it's very, very famous. Correct. This is in the book of Daniel. Right. By the way, the Babylonian kingdom was established in the year of 3319, which is 441bce. When deposed the king of Assyria and assumed the throne. Assyria was the most brutal enemy our people ever faced. You don't hear much about them. Ass. Syria. Ass. Syria was so brutal that they conquered the 10 tribes. This is before the Babylonian empire. They conquered the 10 tribes and they exiled them so far away that three, almost two and a half, two, 2800 years later, we still don't know where they are. We still don't know where they are. We had dribs and drabs from tribes in Peru and in China and in, I don't know, Mongolia. And they say, yeah, we're the lost Jews with the tribe of Dan, with the tribe of Manasseh. That's how good these guys were. They were advancing on Jerusalem and they were about to do the same to the remaining two and a half tribes. Had they been successful, I don't think there would have been any Jews left. But in a miraculous evening under the rule of king, that night was the night of Passover. They all died in a mysterious plague. And that was over. And one of the only surviving soldiers was a young soldier by the name of Nar, who becomes the Babylonian emperor. Right, so you got Assyrians, you've got Babylonians, and now we're moving on to the, the, the Medians and the Persians. Right, okay, good. So Bashar ruled only for 12, for three years. Remember that? Right? Because his kingdom ended the night of his feast. You'll see why. The banquet was occasioned by Ber's military victory over Darius the MEDEA. Since the 70 year period uneventfully passed, felt safe in making personal use of the sacred temple vessels that his grandfather had plundered. He brought out the holy vessels of the temple and he actually wore, he dressed himself in the clothing of the high priest. Can you imagine the, the indignation, the insult? What did he have? Yeah, he wore the, the iPad. Now, okay, now what happened at that feast? Let me just fill you in the missing details here. What happened was at that feast was essentially celebrating the end of the, of the Bab of the Jewish people. So at the feast, he was a wild orgy. And they brought out whatever they needed to bring all the, you know, indulgences they could possibly think of. And they profaned and desecrated the holy vessels of the temple at that feast. Suddenly, in the drunken stupor, they see a handwriting on the wall. The writing was on the wall. This is where the expression comes from. The writing is on the wall. It happened at this feast. Suddenly, a hand appears and starts writing on the wall and writes letters that nobody can read. Mene men te. It's like Chinese up top to bottom. Many, many te. And nobody could read the letters. They were like, what does that say? So eventually they called in Daniel, who was one of the wise men who had been exiled from Jerusalem 52 years earlier. Because remember, Babylon conquered Jerusalem in the 18th year. I think was the 18th year of his reign. I can't remember exactly which year it was, but it was not at the beginning of the rise of the Babylonian empire. Was. Was some decades in. So he sees the writing on the wall. They bring in Daniel and Danny Daniel says it says like this, many, many Hebrew, which means measured, measured, weighed and divided. And he interpreted to me the word divided also means Persians in Hebrew Palestine. So he said measured, measure. The sin of Babylon has been measured, weighed, measured and weighed. This is. Oh, we have a guest from Sri Lanka. Nice to see you. Welcome, welcome. What city in Sri Lanka? You know, so. So weighed and measured is the. Is the sin of the Babylonian emperor. Persians. It's time for the Persians. So he basically said that, that the. The prophecy is telling you that the Persians are going to conquer the Babylonians soon. Well, soon. Yeah. So. So obviously this is the worst nightmare of. Of the Babylonian emperor Bot I can't imagine that. That he was remained drunk for too long. But anyways, he pretty much ended the party and he ordered the palace into lockdown, the. The capital city into lockdown. Nobody was allowed in and nobody was allowed out. And his instructions were such that even if someone claims to be the emperor himself, don't ask any questions. Chop his head off. And. And that's how strict we have to be that night. Bill Shotzer, like the ancient king Pharaoh. Oh, Western Australia. Wow. Cool. This is amazing global worldwide wisdom. So, so just like, just like Pharaoh who considered himself a God. And he did so by telling people that he never went to the bathroom. So what he did was he would go early in the morning when nobody was looking, he would go to the River Nile where, where he would. Nature calls. So Belshazzar did the same thing. And by the way, it's where Moses would meet him. Moses would meet him at his secret hiding spot. And you'd say, I know who you are, okay? You can't fool me, sir. I can see what you're doing. Right. It was pretty humiliating to. To the. To the deity had a similar practice. He had a secret trap door under his bedroom where he would go down to the river to do his thing. And when he came back, he was drunk. Remember? He didn't really remember the whole story. So in the morning he came back to the main entrance, which he comes to. The man says, let me in, I'm the king. Bam. They chopped his head off. And very soon panic ensued. And the Persians who were waiting in hiding, and the Persians and the meads were easily overran. And that was the end of the Babylonian emperor empire. So that ended that night, the night of his feast. Now let's keep on going. The Gamara. Oh, Vashti is part of that story. Vashti is the daughter of Apropos to Belshazza's reckoning. The Gemarian inquires and how do we know that the book reigned for a total of 45 years? How do we know that? As master said, they were exiled in the 7th, they were exiled in the 8th, they were exiled in the 18th, and they were exiled in the 19th. Explains. The first half of this enigmatic statement refers to the different periods of the exile. The exile of the king Yo Yachin occurred in the seventh year following the book of Nessa's conquest of Yohoyakim, which was the eighth year of Nabokanetsa's reign. Don't worry about this so much. It's just the details of of the various exiles of Jerusalem. The second half of the statement also refers to one exile, the exile Titkia, who occurred in the 18th year following the conquest of Yakim. So the 18th year, which was the 19th year's reign. Now, now how do we know that? I'm going to skip that part. Okay, whatever. Should we keep focus here? Now, now the son of reign for 45 years, his son ruled for 23 years. And now this guy Bata is ruling for two years when he finally feels now the Gemara. So now we understand why he made the mistake. Because he calculated from the rise of the Babylonian empire. The Gemara presents a calculation about Hashvarosh who sought to avoid Boshatzer's mistake. Said the Babylonian earned in his calculations. Since he. Since he chose as his starting point the year of Netzar's rights rise to power. The beginning of the Babylonian emperor empire. I shall calculate and not er. I've got a better accountant. Is it written in the prophecy of the general of Jeremiah for the kingdom of Babylon? See, they're analyzing the prophecy of Jeremiah. Does it say seven years from the kingdom of Babylon? It doesn't say that. It doesn't say that. It says. No, it's written merely for Babylon. Seven years for Babylon, not from Babylon. To what does for Babylon then refer to the exile of Babylon. In other words, it's 70 years from the time that the Jews were exiled to Babylon. That's when the 70 years starts 18 years later. Thus how many years must be the leader from B's calculation which began at the end of ascended to the throne the year? The answer is eight years. The eight. Because that's the beginning of the first exile when the the first group of Jews went off to to Israel to Babylon. Eight years of his reign before he exiled Yachin must be deleted. So has calculated and inserted these other years in place of the eight deleted years as follows, he added another eight years, one year remaining of Vershato's reign which did not include in his own calculation. And the five years of Darius the Mede and Cyrus of Persia they ruled together. And then two years of his own reign, which means Here is the 70 years from the exile of Yehoyachin, the first of the Jewish exiles. So he says the third year of his own reign is finally safe. And that's why the opening words of the Megillah is that the king of Kashvers ruled across the whole world, only sat on his throne in the third year, in the third year of Israel. Now because they were calculating with the prophecy of of Jeremiah after the day predicted for redemption past followed the example of El Shotser. He says sincere saw that the seven years were completed and the Jews were not redeemed. He said now certainly they will never be redeemed. Because Jeremiah's prophecy was non fulfilled. He therefore brought out the second vessels of the holy temple and used them at a lavish royal banquet. This didn't work well the first time. As a punish for his insolence, the Satan came and danced amongst them and killed Vashti. Well, what provoked to to want to bring out to want to kill Vashti it was because there was a debate amongst the the men about who are the most beautiful women in the world. This one said our woman, their woman, these women, those women. Until the king couldn't stand it and he said no, my wife is the most beautiful in the world. She was actually a Babylonian Vashti. She was. My wife is the most beautiful and I'm going to prove it to you. She's going to dance naked. I'm going to send send for her to come dance naked. And then she actually would have wanted to dance naked by the way. Sure she would have wanted to. She would force the Jewish maidens that she forced us she enslaved to work naked for her. Texas cool. This is great. So, so she, she would abuse the the Jewish slaves, the female slaves to work naked for her. So she had no problem with nakedness. The problem was the medic tells us that she grew some sort of an appendage like a tail or maybe she broke out in a rash, pimples, you know, whatever. Something happened that was inappropriate photo Appear disrobed in front of the man. And therefore she was insolent to the king. This is all the working of the Satan who set up the conversation, who set up to feel indignant to say, no, my wife is most beautiful to. To. To provoke her to stand up to her husband. This is all the Satan's work behind the scenes. Okay, now insolence was logical too, because she was a daughter of a king and a. Was a stable boy, right? And she actually sent a message. She was a stable boy. Sorry, he was a stable boy in vet's stables. But he was an enterprising entrepreneur, this guy. He clearly rose the ranks. He climbed the corporate ladder. But she was the daughter of Velar who was left alive when the. When the Medes and the Persians conquered Babylon, they left her alive for whatever reason, because they wanted to keep a royal blood alive. She sent the message, you're so drunk, you're not even a nothing to my father. My father could drink a thousand goblets of wine and keep his cool. You drank a few cups and now you've totally lost it. That didn't go well. He didn't like it. Okay, just one quick summary I want to give you over here. The sequence of events, right, Just a sequence of events, you guys. In summary, the kingdom of Babylon was founded in 3319 since creation, when Nevokanessa deposed the king of Ashura to the throne. One year later, the Babylonian domination of the Jewish people began when the mighty legions of N overwhelmed King Yah, King King Yakim and his forces. Remember, there was only two and a half tribes of the Jews remaining after the Assyrians had exiled the first 10 tribes. Seven years years later, in 3327 since creation, the first mass waves of exiles, including the greatest scholars and leaders of the Jewish nation were taken to Babylon. So this would have been the eighth year of Netar. Even though the domination of the Jews began in the. In the second year, in the second year of his. Of. Of Babylon. Right? But still the conquest, the exile to Babylon began in the eighth year along with Joachim, the son of Joachim, their king, called the exile of Joachin. This first exile expulsion occurred in the 8th year of reign. 11 years later. This is going to be very important to understand this 11 years later, right? 11 years later, in 3338, the Babylonian army swept across the Jewish kingdom, this time ravaging the temple. This very important to understand that, because that's going to be the correct calculation. Since the fall of the temple 11 years after Aasha's erroneous calculation and driving King city and his people into exile. This misfortune took place in the 19th year's rule, 18 years after Yakim was captured. Now it's going to be very important to understand that piece. So you got three calculations. Bel calculated seven years from the rise of the Babylonian empire. Achashverish calculated the seven years from the first exile which happened eight years later. The real answer was 11 years after that, which was really 18 years since the rise of the Babylonian empire when the temple was destroyed. And that's the enigma that Jeremiah failed to clarify deliberately. He deliberately kept it ambiguous so nobody would know because you don't want to make prophecies, you know, whenever you prophesize, you don't want to keep it too obvious. You want to give them what to think about. So. So Akashversh was very, very mistaken right now. What's the mistake of Akash Veres? Akash said in his calculations, since he chose as a starting point the year of the rise to power, I shall calculate and shall not ear. Is it written in the prophecy of. Did I do this? I think I did this, right? Yes, I did this, right. Okay, fine. So after they predicted for redemption passed followed the example of Bashatzer and he brought the. He brought out the holy vessels and he profaned them at his at his feast. Now the G appears to have calculated correctly. If so, why was the deliverance delayed another 11 years until the Jews came to Israel 11 years later? By the answer was by calculating the seventh years from the exile of Yin, the first exile also earth. For he should have counted the seven years from the destruction of Jerusalem which occurred 11 years after Yachin was exiled. Okay, now I want to point out the following. I want to point out the following. So what actually happened on the end here was that why did Akashversh hate the Jews so much? Why was he so willing to depose the Jews when haman offers him 10,000 talents of silver to commit genocide? I mean, that's a very serious offense. The reason was because Ahasuerus was extremely insecure about the Jews. He was extremely insecure about the Jews. Remember the third year of his reign is when he threw this feast. Esther becomes Queen in the seventh year of his reign. Haman shows up in the 12th year of his reign. So he was insecure about the whole thing. So what happened was when he was afraid that the Jews were going to take over his kingdom based on the prophecy of Jeremiah. So when, when he Heard that somebody was willing to do the dirty work for him. He's like, no problem, you do it and don't worry about payment. Be my pleasure to grant you this, this decree. But what happened when Esther, when Esther appeals to the king and she says, listen, somebody's trying to kill me and my people. She's like, what? Who's trying to kill you and your people? And she says, him, Haman. No, sorry, sir, I'm between Haman. So he says, really? It suddenly it dawns on that his own wife is a Jew. He never knew that it was a secret. And when he realizes that his own wife is a Jew, he realizes that their son Darius II is a Jew. So then he realized one second, when it means that the Jews are going to rule after me, the prophecy is my own son. I have no problem. My own son, really, that's fine. And that's why he, he just switched immediately, just switched over. And he said, no problem, we'll just hang Haman. Like this guy, he was so willing to sell the Jews out for nothing, right? Throw them under the bus in genocide. Suddenly he's like, oh, it's him, no problem, we'll just kill him. Because his animosity just totally ebbed when he realized that it was his own son who was going to be the king, the next king of his empire. So suddenly, all his anti Semitism destroyed, disappeared, kills Hamad. And now what happens is Darius soon rises to the throne. Darius the Persian rises to the throne. Remember, Akash became king in the year 3393. Darius, Esther's son, rises to power in 3407, which is 7, 14 years later, he rises to power in the 14th, in the 14 years later after, right? And one of the first things that he does, Darius, by the way, was also known as Cyrus, because remember those two kings, you know, it's like the name Pharaoh. You know, when you become something really important, you have to adopt the name of some, you know, Pharaoh the first, Pharaoh the second. Like, you know, they do that. So, so there were these certain names that people would adopt. Now since Darius and Cyrus were, were the Persians and the mead rulers of, of that took over Babylon, these were both royal names. So he was known both as Darius and Osiris. So when we talk about Cyrus the Great who sent the Jews back to sponsor them to rebuild the second temple, we're talking about the son of Esther and Akashverash. We're talking about Darius, right? That's who this guy is. So when President Trump was was called by Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State. When he called him Cyrus, what he meant was he was referring to this story when, when President Trump, in the first. First reign, first iteration, first. What do they call it? First presidency. Right. When he. When he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and he moved the embassy that's in. Pompeo said that he's Cyrus, what was he talking about? Somebody gentile, a non Jew, who is. Who has the wisdom and the vision and the courage to be able to recognize the Jewish homeland as. And Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish people. It was actually quite an interesting historic correlation to compare Cyrus to Trump. I mean, whatever, without getting political right now, but it doesn't matter. I'm not getting political right now, but I'm just saying the historical connection is beautiful. Where you had an ancient emperor who didn't know that he was Jewish because Cyrus actually was Jewish. He just didn't practice as a Jew because it was probably too dangerous for Esther to tell her husband that. By the way, Einstein is keeping Shabbos. So, you know, that was a little complicated. So did he have a brisk. I don't know. I never checked. I don't know. Cyrus's mother was Esther. Esther. Yeah. But he knew that Esther was a Jew, right? Yeah, but I don't know if. I don't know how he identified. I'm not sure how Cyrus, Darius identified. Did he identify as a Jew? Do you identify as a Persian? It sounds like when you read historical books and you see the. The tombs and the writings and Darius ii, it's all very Persian, not so Jewish. Right. I didn't see Shamay Israel written on his tombstone, but. Yeah. Anyways, bottom line is that. That what happened in the end here was, is that the edict of Cyrus. The edict of Cyrus was to send the Jews back from Persia to rebuild their temple in Jerusalem. And that happened when? 70 years exactly. To the fall of Jerusalem, not to the rise of Babylon, like, like Belshazzar erroneously calculated. And not 70 years to the first exile, the first wave of exiles, the exile of Yo Yachin, the king, which happened eight years after that, but rather what happened 14 years later than that, which was the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. And it was 70 years since that event that the Jewish people are now sent back to Jerusalem to build their temple, sponsored and protected by the Iranians. Right. It's actually interesting what it says that the Iranians have a special merit. The Persians. Iranians have, do have a special merit. And I remember reading the Gemara that They have some sort of a merit that they will be able to be the last war before the coming of Mashiach. They'll be the last holdout before they come and give Mashiach. Because they have this extraordinary merit that they. That they were the ones that were responsible for the rebuilding of our temple. They actually made it happen. Let me just see if there's anything else I want to share with you here in this piece of Talmud, which is such a beautiful piece of Talmud that really comes and gives us so much context to the backdrop of the Purim story, where you realize it's like a little. A little scene, a sequence of scenes which is part of a far greater picture that started with Moses and ultimately Babylon, the destro. The destroying a temple, which then, by the way, the end of the story. What happens in the rest of the story, they go back, they rebuild the temple, and that's when Ezra and Kya, they go out and they rebuild the temple. And there's the establishment of the Jewish people in the land of Israel. And now you're starting to see the emergence of the Talmud, the centers of learning. There's the Jerusalem Talmud, obviously in Israel, but then there's the center of learning moving to Babylon, and the Babylonian Talmud, which is what we're learning right now, the Babylonian Talmud, the center of Jewish life and learning, slowly moves over to Babylon. Why? Because with the rise of the Romans in the land of Israel, because remember who took over the Persians in the land of Israel? It was the Greeks who conquered the Persians. And then the Romans conquered the Greeks. Right, the Romans conquered the Greeks. So what happens now is in the land of Israel, life becomes unbearable when Constantine adopts Christianity as his official religion and he ramps up anti Semitism to intolerable levels. So what happens then is that the Jews flee the land of Israel and they move to Babylon, which makes Babylon the scent of Jewish learning. Which is why the Babylonian Talmud is far more famous and important than the Jerusalem Talmud. Ultimately, this leads to a period where the tour where the temple is built in. In. In the land of Israel and the Greeks come in and they try to conquer it. They do, and they conquer it. In the Hanukkah story, where they defile the oils, but they don't destroy it. It was only later, the next empire, the Romans, who come on in and actually destroy it. And we're still trying to rebuild it ever since. But you see the sequence from Egyptians to Babylonians to Persians, which is the Purim story, and then on to the Greeks and the Romans. Understanding the greater context, the historical context and the chilling spiritual context of the prophecy of Jeremiah that when he says that the temple will be rebuilt, it was actually rebuilt exactly at the time. Now, a few things come out of this. Few thoughts. Closing thoughts here, folks. Number one, I want you to realize when you read about the Jews going to this feast, what, what kind of travesty it was for them to attend this feast. What a travesty it was for the Jews to attend this feast even though the food is kosher. Can you imagine attending a feast which is celebrating the death of Judaism? I mean, that's just awful. That's absolutely awful. What a stab in the back of God. And that's why the Gemara says that they asked, why were the Jews worthy of genocide in the Purim story. And Ravishema says, because they enjoyed that feast of Akashversh. What's the big sin of enjoying the feast of Akashversh? The food is kosher. What's the problem? Because it says in the mcillah, the food is kosher. They. I forget the exact word. Kadas. Each person was. Was given food to order. That's what it says. They're given food to order in the royal palace. And they. They spare no expense. They were. They ordered the food from, you know, from kosher. Yeah, a real kosher place, right? Oh, so that's exactly the important story. That's exactly important. So let me just say this. So first of all, why were they worthy of genocide? Is because when we turn our backs on God, then God turns his back on us. And that's essentially what they did to us. Well, they did to God by turning their backs on God, they're saying, look, we don't need God because we have friends in high places. We have friends in the White House. We have friends in Shushan. So we're not afraid to celebrate the death of Judaism, the death of the Jewish God, the death of Jeremiah and his prophecy, because we have friends who care about us, who invite us into the royal palace. So God says, okay, you don't need me. Fine, carry on without me. And let's see how you manage with your new friends. Right? Let's see how the sheep manages with her new friends, the 70 wolves. Right? And we see how that panned out. So the question Rob is asking, so why then were the Jews worthy of redemption? And this is exactly the point where I think I said this yesterday, that on that night, the king. The. The sleep of the king was. Was. Was aroused. Was aroused. The king was aroused from his slumber. And Hasidis explained that the reference here is to the King. To the king. To God. God the King on that night, which means a state of double darkness. It was not only night, a state of. Of darkness, spiritual darkness, but it was that night, not this night, which means a double darkness, a double state of spiritual comatose. The people were so far removed from this spiritual observance that they didn't even know what they didn't even know. They completely lost the plot. Even though it was a very, very dark spiritual night. And therefore God had every reason to turn his back on us. Nevertheless, the sleep of the King was stirred. The fact that God woke up without being initiated by us, but rather by him intervening at the 11th hour, that is the Purima story that actually was despite us, not because us, that God intervened. And that's why you're supposed to raise your voice when you read the Megillah at the beginning of chapter five. At the beginning of this point. Yeah, so. So that's an interesting question, but I don't think. Hang on, did that happen? Did that happen earlier or later? The fasting? Before. Okay, so. So I'm in the middle of a discourse. I'm in the middle of learning a discourse on the Rebbe in 1965 where he's asking that exact question. So I don't know the answer to it yet. The Rebbe brings the altar Rebbe who says that God woke up despite the spiritual slumber of the Jewish people. But then he brings a question from the previous Rebbe who says. Exactly your question, Andy. That it was the self sacrifice of the Jews at that time that seems to have aroused God. So which one was it? Was it the Jewish people in a state of slumber or was it the Jewish people in a state of arousal? So I don't know the answer to that question, but I am working on it. From the rebbe's discourse in 1965. How said God arouse? God's always up. No, it's not true. You're. You're coming with preconceived notions. And you did the same mistake yesterday that Hasidus teaches us. Don't. Don't put God in a box. Don't put God. I'm serious. We should all not do this. Don't put God in a box. Don't create God in your image, but rather create us in his image. Right? So if you're going to learn about God, people come in with notions and they say, well, God should be doing this, that, and the Other for me. And if he's not, therefore I'm out. Abandon your preconceived notions. Learn Torah to learn who God is and what God does. And that's why don't. You can't challenge the premise what the Torah is telling us. You say, well, God is, should be doing this. Well, where do you get that piece of information from? The answer is no, it's not. It's actually a Christian belief that you just brought up that God should somehow always be present and always be kind and always be loving. Reminds me of, of the. When I was flying on a plane, I was like 18 years old and flying from South Africa to Israel and there was a guy sitting next to me, he was a missionary and he thought that he's got a captive audience here as young Jewish for the next 12 hours of the flight to be able to convert him to Christianity on the way to Shiva. So the guy was talking and I was in no mood. I was in no mood. Eventually he's telling me about how, how God first chose the Jewish people613 commandments, but then they failed miserably and he realized that it was too hard and he gave up the Jews for another people, gave the Jews for another people, for the Christians, and he gave up the 613 commandments for one commandment. And that commandment was love. That's it. And that's the New Testament. So I repeated the story. I said to him, I need to understand something. So it was in the name of love that you massacred my grandparents in the Holocaust? Was it in the name of love that you massacred my ancestors in the First Crusade, the second Crusade, in the Spanish Inquisition, you burned them at the stake. And all the other tortures that are unspeakable throughout the Middle Ages that the Vatican and the Church did to our people, that was all in the name of love. So the guy was like, I need the bathroom. You're in the bathroom. I never saw him the rest of the flight. They had two seats. So my point is, my point is that don't bring your preconceived notions to the table. We're open, our hearts are open, our minds are open to new ideas, to new paradigms, to be able to understand God and not create God in our image. But I want to conclude with one closing point. Class. In those days, and in these days, it's fun to read the story in hindsight and say, well, you see, they got the 70 years wrong. And if only shots are new. Hahaha. Right. And the Same thing with Akashverish. Hahaha. He got it wrong and was Darius ii. He's the guy. Because they should have known. Well, guess what? There's another prophecy at play today. And most of the Jews are comatose to it, are asleep to it. There's a prophecy of redemption. The Rebbe is the prophet of our generation. And he promised us that Mashiach is coming very, very soon. He promised us that the best days of our lives are about to happen at any moment in time. He actually said that. It makes no sense. In 1991, right after Pesach, 1991. He says, Kit, he says, all calculations as to when M should come, the redemption, the M should come, have all passed. All signs, all codes, all perpetuous times, every single one of them has passed. And it makes zero sense why Mashiach is not here yet. It's got to be that he's just going to be here at any instant. Now, we can approach this with one or two ways. We can either turn a cold shoulder and say whatever, or we can say, I'm going to be one of the wise men. I'm going to be one of the believers. Because every other prophecy in Jewish history, by the way, has come true. Just saying. Every single other prophecy in Jewish history has come true. And if you doubt that, the fact that you're still here is proof of that. Right? So the fact that the Jewish people have survived to tell the tale is proof of the fact that every single prophecy has come true. And. And even when we're on the precipice of genocide, like in the perm story, God intervened and still saved us, true to his prophecy. So right now we're. We're at the cusp of a prophecy which, by the way, is already being fulfilled in so many ways. When. When we learn about flying on the wings of eagles to the Holy Land, we understand that. When we understand about that, there'll be no more illness. There'll be no more illness is what it says. You know what that means? No more illness. Well, there's all sorts of diseases being cured every single day. Illness, the deafness, there's blindness, there's Alzheimer's. They're coming out with cures left, right and center. We're seeing the fulfillment of these prophecies, the eradication of poverty. We're seeing all sorts of fascinating programs and endowments and government initiatives that are curing and solving problems all over the world. We are living in the fulfillment of biblical times. And friends, the Rebbe said to us, the Rebbe said, don't be caught asleep. Don't be caught asleep. Even though your brother or your sister in law might be making fun of you and saying, oh, you're becoming all religious. What did the rabbi do to you? You're drinking the Kool Aid. Ignore the scoffers, folks. Ignore. Jewish history is filled with Jewish people who have the strength to stand up to the scoffers. Us. Let's not, let's not make that mistake of becoming one of the scoffers or being intimidated by those who mock us. Let's be the ones that make things happen instead of the ones that watch things happen. We saw those miracles happen against Allah. Can you imagine what the stamina of the Jewish people must have been like after. After. Imagine what the hope of the Jewish people must have felt like during the. They actually surrendered. They said, here we are. God has abandoned us and we are pledging allegiance to Akash. That's what they said. Because they actually believed that the prophecy was dead, that the God of Israel was dead. But it took those few Jews, Mordechai and his few men who were able to stand strong. These were the ones who were able to turn the tide. And history was always. The revolutions of history always happened not through large groups of. Of people, but through small groups of inspired men and women. A Torah portion. Parsha with the golden calf. The golden calf too. Yes. It's a big topic. I want to go into that right now. But I want to say small groups of inspired people that change the world and we can be those people that's been inspired by the lessons of our history make a difference to bring Mashiach now. Amen. I still have money in my Iraq.\n"
